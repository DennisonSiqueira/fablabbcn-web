<p><strong>3.1 Introduction</strong><br/>

Fab Labs and advanced manufacturing infrastructure are making accessible for any citizen to make anything anywhere, while sharing it with global networks of knowledge, which allows to accelerate design, development and deployment processes for new products to be born. Traditional planning and urbanism are being disrupted by the acceleration of technology and the dynamic transformation of society during the last half century; it is important to rethink how we make things and why, and generate active and practical conversations through projects and prototypes that become manifests itself.  The Fab City wants to explore new opportunities and methods to transform the city.</p><br/><br/>


<p><strong>3.2 Fab City: the concept</strong><br/>

A Fab City is a new urban model for locally productive and globally connected self sufficient cities.It is a new urban model of transforming and shaping cities that shifts how they source and use materials from  ‘Products In Trash Out’ (PITO) to ‘Data In Data Out’ (DIDO). This means that more production occurs inside the city, along with recycling materials and meeting local needs through local inventiveness. A city’s imports and exports would mostly be found in the form of data (information, knowledge, design, code).In this way, the citizens and the city are empowered to be the masters of their own destiny, their resilience is increased and a more ecological system is developed because the movements of materials and the associated energy consumption and carbon emissions typical of the current economy are drastically reduced. In order for this to be possible, the city must be locally productive and globally connected to knowledge, economic and social networks, making cooperation between cities, citizens and knowledge centers the basis of the scientific knowledge.<br/>

The Fab City has been initiated by the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia, the MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms and the Fab Foundation; it operates within the Fab Lab network, using it as a global infrastructure and knowledge source for the radical transformation on how we work, live and play in cities.</p><br/><br/>


<p><strong>3.3 Main topics for the Contest:</strong><br/>

The contest aims at developing new approaches and technological solutions, for:</p><br/><br/>

<p><strong>ENERGY</strong><br/>
Intro: With the advent of domestic batteries and efficiency improvements in solar and other means of clean power generation, energy distribution itself will face enormous changes. Distributed grids will change the role of households and businesses in power, water and resources distribution.
Scope: Projects pointing to improve sustainable energy production and distribution, in different scales (urban, neighborhoods, houses and buildings, things).
Examples: Fab Energy , Tarpunometre , Moss Voltaics , Hydroceramic , Electric Water Heater , Precious plastic </p><br/><br/>

<p><strong>FOOD</strong><br/>
Intro: Urban farming will scale up from experimental practice to large scale infrastructure. Local production of foods at domestic, neighbourhood and city scales, will create a closed loop system for food production and harvesting.
Scope: Projects focused on food production, harvesting and distribution in urban environments. 
Examples:  Aquapioneers , Farmbot ,  Open Grow,  Mykonos , Mamotok ,  Open Source Beehives, Open Hydroponics , GIY , My Biosphere </p><br/><br/>

<p><strong>EDUCATION</strong><br/>
Intro: Educating for the future: incorporate a stronger emphasis on  learning-by-doing in education systems, and  engage all levels of education in finding solutions for local needs, through digital fabrication technologies, and  sharing them with global networks.
Scope: Projects focused on Active Learning tools and devices
Examples: The Maze , Disorder , Craft Book , The FrankensToy, Rec KIDS, Escornabot</p><br/><br/>

<p><strong>COMMUNITY </strong><br/>
Intro: Exploring how open source software and hardware, digital fabrication and open design can be used by local communities to design solutions to their local problems. By empowering citizens and engaging them in civic action, these technologies provide new ways of building social movements, delivering public services and creating social impact in fields as diverse as healthcare, education, democracy, environment, transport and housing.
Scope: Devices and tools for sustainable solutions in decentralized communities.
Examples: Making Sense , Open Source Beehives, Smart Citizen , Precious plastic , Precious PLastic Extruder , W.Afate 3D printer </p><br/><br/>

        
        
        
        
        
        
        <p>The Fab Academy is completed by combining 19 certificates that demonstrate familiarity and experience with various topics and technologies covered. The course is organised by week:</p>

        <h3>Fab Diploma</h3> 

        <p style="font-size:18px;"><em>The Fab Diploma is awarded by the Fab Academy upon completion of the course requirements. This is earned by demonstrating progress rather than just finishing the course calendar. To receive the Fab Diploma, each student must demonstrate to have completed each week’s requirements, receiving their certificate for the relevant technical topics. For their final evaluation, students must build, demonstrate and document a final project that integrates the various tools and techniques covered by the course.</em></p>

	    <p>Fab Academy offers a unique and collaborative learning experience. The Fab Lab provides the space, inventory and machines for students to pursue their own project goals while participating in an interactive global classroom where they can share their progress, ideas, problems and solutions. Fab Academy teaches a <strong>“learning to learn”</strong> approach, where students share methods and best practices in an open-source and collaborative environment.</p> 
            
            <br/>
            
        <p>Students are supported by <strong><a href="https://fablabbcn.org/about_us.html" target="blank">local instructors</a></strong> who guide students in the various assignments and topics covered. Every week is introduced via an <strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/201139985" target="blank">interactive video stream</a></strong> guided by Neil Gershenfeld, where students share their progress, ask questions and receive feedback. The course is complimented by a series of <strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/207127508" target="blank">live recitations</a></strong> each week from experts and professionals from various fields, all who are using digital fabrication to innovate in new and exciting ways.</p>
        
            <br/>
            
        <p>The course is divided into a <strong><a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/master/schedule.html" target="blank">20 week program</a></strong>, with each week or two covering a different technology and skill. There is no global accreditation for these skills. Instead, <strong>each student builds an individual web portfolio to document their progress</strong>, trials and errors; integrating what they have learnt into a final project that gets evaluated together with their overall progress in the course.</p>
