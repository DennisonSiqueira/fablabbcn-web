The Distributed Design Market Platform acts as an exchange and networking hub for the European Maker Movement. The initiative aims at developing and promoting the connection between designers, makers and the market.

The Distributed Design Market Platform is a four-year project funded by the European Union through the Creative Europe fund. It acts as an exchange and networking hub for the European Maker Movement. It consists of both online and offline activities such as events, resources, workshops, fairs and bootcamps that promote and advocate for emerging creative talent in Europe and their business productivity and sustainability. With events across Europe the Platform also supports the mobility of emerging creatives and their work.

Distributed Design is one outcome of the intersection of two global trends: the Maker Movement and the digitisation of the design discipline. This convergence has lead to the rise of a new market, in which creative individuals have access to digital tools that allow them to design, produce and fabricate products themselves or easily connect to a global network of collaborators to undertake aspects of this process with them. We call this process and the subsequent market which is emerging from these trends, Distributed Design.
