The iSCAPE is a project aims to integrate and advance the control of air quality and carbon emissions in European cities in the context of climate change through the development of sustainable and passive air pollution remediation strategies, policy interventions and behavioural change initiatives. It will tackle the problem of reducing air pollution at target receptors with an innovative SME-led approach, focusing on the use of “Passive Control Systems” in urban spaces.

The project has been funded for 3 years under the call H2020-SC5-04-2015 "Improving the air quality and reducing the carbon footprint of European cities" with a total contribution of more than 5 million €.

Fab Lab Barcelona is providing his expertise on open and low-cost sensors by developing a new generation of Smart Citizen Kits that will be tested by communities across Europe to learn about air quality. We are also coordinating the deployment of passive pollution control systems on 7 European cities that will be monitored using this technology.
