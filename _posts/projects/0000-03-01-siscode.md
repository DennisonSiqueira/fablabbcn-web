title: SISCODE
meta: Different policies and programmes have been developed across Europe, over the last decade, to increase the permeability between science, innovation and society to render the former two better oriented towards the needs, demands and expectations of the latter. The overarching aim of SISCODE is to better understand co-creation as a bottom-up and design-driven phenomenon that is flourishing in Europe (in fab labs, living labs, social innovations, smart cities, communities and regions), to analyse favourable conditions that support its scalability and replication and to use this knowledge to cross-fertilise RRI practices and policies.

This aim is articulated along three main operational objectives:

1. To create and run a European-wide study of existing local, regional, national and European co-creation ecosystems and to describe effective dynamics and outcomes for the implementable integration of society in science and innovation. The study will analyse and compare the following: the different cultural, organisational, institutional and regulatory conditions under which co-creation flourishes; the diversities among actors and stakeholders involved (gender, culture, education and backgrounds) that favour co-creation; the typologies of challenges and the citizens they affect (including vulnerable groups, women, children, migrants etc.); and the characteristics of the co-produced solutions;

2. To experiment with design as a new system of competences on which to build capacity for implementable co-creation in RRI and STI policy making;

3. To understand the cultural, organisational and procedural transformations needed to embed co-creation as a design-driven approach in RRI processes and STI policy making, overcoming barriers and resistance to change.
