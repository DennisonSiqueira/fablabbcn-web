TCBL Textile & Clothing Business Labs is building a multi-faceted business ecosystem of sector enterprises, innovation labs, service providers, and business advisors, all working together to transform the Textiles and Clothing industry. The common objective is to build alternative paths to over-production and diminishing value while returning 5% of production capacity and reducing environmental footprint by 20%, within 2025.

In its first two years of operations, TCBL has built a valued-based community of 136 enterprises, 28 business labs, 75 expert advisors, 12 service providers, and 7 startups collaborating towards this shared goal. Innovative business models are currently being explored for re-structuring supply chains (natural cotton and eco-friendly production), re-shaping production processes (short runs and independents) and re-framing customer values (bacteria dyeing and digital heritage).
