title: DO-IT 
meta: DO-IT is the European Initiative to empower Europe’s young innovators in an open digital world with the skills and tools they need from early on in life. The project empowers primary and secondary school pupils (6-16 years) alongside educators to apply open innovation methods, digital maker tools and collaboration skills to tackle societal problems.

The DO-IT initiative builds on innovative open educational approaches that favour concrete making, application and experiences. The programme is piloted and evaluated across 10 European countries, in schools, innovation labs, maker spaces and social enterprises. It offers intergenerational workshops and training events targeted at different learning needs and settings. DO-IT’s online Idea Competition, open to all children in Europe, will inspire them to pursue an entrepreneurial career path.
