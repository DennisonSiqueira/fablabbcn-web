<h2>NERO: DATA MATTER</h2>

Areal Robotic became a common tool for Construction Techniques, Photogrammetry, Transportation, Agriculture, Security and Rescue, Environmental research and many more applications. The aim of the workshop is to create a theoretical and experimental framework, based on open-source tools, with the scope of extracting data from the air to better understand the environment and intervene in design objectives
 
Design; explore emergent behaviors, chaos, fractals and many more inspiring concepts based on the principles of looping data

NOUMENA, in collaboration with IAAC | GREEN FABLAB, present: NERO | networking environmental robotics workshop.The course will be structured in multiple phases, generating a dynamic workflow from digital to analog and vice versa to offer a firsthand experience with aerial robotics, data mapping and data visualization. Aim of the workshop is to create a theoretical and experimental framework, based on open-source tools, with the scope of extracting data from the air to better understand the environment and intervene in design objectives. Main tool of the course will be NERO, an open-source drone developed by NOUMENA and already presented in several international events and exhibitions such as Fab10, Maker Faire Rome, and Beyond Building Barcelona/Construmat.NERO is a project developed in a collaborative manner, pursuing several applications through computation and coding turning a basic drone into a multidisciplinary and professional tool.

The whole workshop is divided in different phases through which participants will develop several skills, mainly focused on DATA.First phase of the workshop is about an Introduction to computational tools, developing a parametric drone. During these phase students willobserve the process of digital fabrication through laser cutting the frame structure and assembling all required parts; program and update the firmware to prepare the drone for its first fly.

In the second phase of the workshop, students will learn about all correlatedsoftware and hardware to fly and measure the environmental data.  The idea is to understand the strategies to fly drone autonomously in an optimize way and to collect augmented data. This phase involves different devices; mapping the terrain via near-infrared filtered camera and sense the environment by Smart Citizen board to collect other environmental data such as temperature, humidity, noise, co2, etc.

In the last phase of the course, participants will embrace computational techniques, learning how to organize and visualize data, generating environmental 3-Dimensional maps, elaborating these maps and database as a resourceful informative documents to it’s natural and social context.
