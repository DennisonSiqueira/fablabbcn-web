##RECURSIONS : ITERATIVE STRATEGIES

Recursion in mathematics and computer science, is a method in which the function being dened is applied within its own denition. The term is also used more generally to describe a process of repeating objects in a self-similar way. This workshop explores iterative strategies through parametric design.
The main tool for the course will be grasshopper3d and its add-on Anemone. Anemone is a simple but eective plug-in for Grasshopper that enables for loops in a simple and linear way. We will explore several design strategies such iterative growth, L systems, fractals, recursive subdivisions and more.
The course will focus on how those methods can aect three-dimensional geometries, generating unexpected conformations.
The workshop is open to all participants, no previous knowledge of Rhinoceros, Grasshopper or tailoring techniques is required (although an introductory knowledge is welcome).
