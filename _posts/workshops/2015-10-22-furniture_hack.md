Everyday somewhere in Barcelona you will find old or broken furniture even entire apartment interiors after flat restorations on the street. Often these objects only need a little hack / love and restoration for a new life. Participants can bring any furniture / material they want to hack, restore or upgrade with style in Fab Lab´s furniture hospital.


Objects can be up-cycled using CNC milling, laser cutting and 3D printing with help from professionals.
