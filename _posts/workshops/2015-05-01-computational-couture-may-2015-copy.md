meta: "COMPUTATIONAL COUTURE WORKSHOP AT BEYOND BUILDING BARCELONA FAIRE

Expanding the horizons of dress making towards an algorithmic approach

Clothes can be considered as the very first form of mediators between body, space and events, condensing in their aesthetics not only the evolution of its relation to the physical functions of the body (movement, protection, temperature regulation) but also the evolution of cultural expression precisely by exceeding the purely indexical performative relations, designing not only for the needs but for the desires."

###Computational Couture Workshop // May 2015

<br>

##1

<br>

Computational couture looks at the creation of exclusive custom-fitted clothing (typical of haute couture) through the lens of a systemic approach, extending the sartorial techniques with 3D modeling and computation-based approaches developed in Rhinoceros and the visual programming environment Grasshopper.

<br>

The aim of the workshop is to exert, infuse and expand the sartorial sensibilities to body proportions and dress making into an algorithmic approach that loops through design and fabrication by means of laser cutting and 3d printing for the design and production of a garment.
Participants will be divided in teams focusing on specific aspects of the garment related to the production technique (laser cutting or 3D printing).
