###Building With Robots // May 2015

<br>

During the last decades, the accessibility of the technology to new users has increased dramatically, with many manufacturers adopting open standards for connectivity and programming. Designers have taken the flexible nature of industrial robotic technology as more than just an enabler of computationally derived formal complexity; instead they have leveraged it as an opportunity to reconsider the entire design-to-production chain toward mass customization, the use of new material, new process and toward the rise of new design opportunities.

<br>

##1

<br>

This workshop will be the place to learn and discuss about robots in architecture and its possibilities to change actual production processes.

<br>

Participants will be introduced to generative design, digital crafting, coding, robotic simulation and will end with the manipulation of the actual robot present on site.

<br>

###REQUIREMENTS

<br>

Participants are required to bring their own laptops with the following OS and software installed :

<br>

– Windows 7 or 8
– Rhinoceros 3D 5.3.xxx
– Grasshopper 0.9.7xxx
<br>

Familiarities with those software is highly recommended.
All software can be downloaded from their respective website. (as Trial version)
Additional plugin and scripts will be provided by the tutors.
