Taught in <strong>Barcelona</strong>, one of the <strong>European capitals of innovation</strong>, the innovative program focuses in looking at the big challenges faced by humanity today in relation to <strong>climate change, sustainability, disenfranchisement and social exclusion through the lens of critical design and social innovation</strong>.

The course will inspire, inform and critique design interventions harnessing the potential of advanced technologies such <strong>digital fabrication, artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, and blockchain</strong> aimed to address and dissolve wicked problems, while contributing learning outcomes, innovative designs and positive social impact.

The first edition of the master, co-directed by Tomas Diez, Mara Balestrini and Òscar Tomico, will incorporate advisors and guest faculty such as: Neil Gershenfeld, Director of the Center for Bits and Atoms at MIT and Fab Academy Program / Indy Johar, Founder of Dark Matter Labs / James Tooze, Royal College of Arts and Design / Liz Corbin, Institute of Making, UCL / Usman Haque, Umbrellium / Denis Dollens (PhD), Studio Exodesic. 

The programme focuses on the <strong>design of interventions in the form of products, platforms and deployments that aim to produce new emergent futures</strong>, by previously analysing the current challenges in society and industry. Students will be encouraged to <strong>work on multiple scales</strong> in order to design and test interventions in the real world.

The MDEF programme is recommended for <strong>designers, sociologists, computer scientists, economists, anthropologists, technology entrepreneurs and changemakers</strong> who are looking to develop an <strong>interdisciplinary and hybrid career</strong> path to conceive and produce impactful ideas to transform the established order.
