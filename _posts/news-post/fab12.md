A first in China: FAB12, the international fablab conference, took place on August 8-14 in Shenzhen, the city that produces 80% of the worldâ€™s electronics. Hundreds of labs from 64 countries convened around mass fabrication and maker empowerment. And France was chosen to host FAB14!


<h4>The first Fab City Summit took place last April 20th with an Expert Meeting&nbsp; followed by a Public Dialogue. The experts worked in the Fab City manifesto in Amsterdam Makerversity and Fab City Campus, and showed some of the conclusions at Park Huis de Zwiger.</h4>

A worldwide network is working out the concept of locally productive and globally connected cities: a Fab City. Fab City is a new urban model for self-sufficient cities in which citizens are empowered. To become a Fab City requires having a more precise knowledge of the way cities work.

<h4>The answer is: yes! Finally, Amsterdam joined the Fab City pledge, so today there's nine cities that joined this global iniciative: Barcelona, Boston, Somerville, Cambridge, Ekurhuleni, Kerala, Georgia, Shenzhen and Amsterdam.</h4>
