Everyday somewhere in Barcelona you will find old or broken furniture even entire apartment interiors after flat restorations on the street. Often these objects only need a little hack / love and restoration for a new life. Participants can bring any furniture / material they want to hack, restore or upgrade with style in Fab Lab´s furniture hospital.<br>
Objects can be up-cycled using CNC milling, laser cutting and 3D printing with help from professionals.<br>

The design Works, made during the workshop held by <strong>Ingi Freyr Gudjónsson</strong>, <strong>Matthew Guarnaccia</strong> and <strong>Ricaro Valbuena</strong>, have been exhibited for a week. The visitors have been able to appreciate the pieces made with digital fabrication and maker creativity.<br>
