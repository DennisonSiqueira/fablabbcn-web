<p><strong><a href="http://www.needlab.org/" target="blank">Needlab</a></strong> is a non-profit architectural research organization who has been partnering with <strong><a href="http://fablabbcn.org/projects.html" target="blank">Fab Lab Barcelona</a></strong> to exploring how digital fabrication can have a positive social impact. For Sameera this begins with honouring our connections to places and people. This helps us develop a sense of responsibility in how we use local materials, respond to social needs, and respect cultural heritage and the environment.</p>

<p><em>“We stand by our motto of the people, by the people, for the people and believe that architecture is responsible of making lives better.” </em></p>

<p>Digital fabrication is often framed about the technology, the digital process of production and the machines that make manufacturing complex structures relatively simple and accesible. While this can be praised as a good in itself, too often we disregard how this technology can have a positive or negative social impact to the very communities who need it most.</p>


<p><strong><a href="http://fablabbcn.org/news/2017/08/28/B_project.html" target="blank">B_Project</a></strong> is a case example. Working with poor communities in India’s Araku valley, the project helped create alternative livelihoods through building <strong><a href="https://www.osbeehives.com/" target="blank">Open Source Beehives</a></strong> for and by local beekeeping cooperatives. This also involved learning from these communities and understanding their needs, customs, and relationship with the surrounding ecosystem.</p>

<p>“We want these communities to be connected among themselves and help each other out, share information about what worked for them, what didn’t work for them and grow,” says Sameera.</p>

<p>Fab Lab Barcelona has been pioneering the <strong><a href="http://fab.city/" target="blank">Fab City</a></strong> project which  involves empowering communities to become self-reliant through urban farming, local manufacturing, distributed energy and a circular economy. A vital component in this is also education and building bridges between a networked society and local governments to create globally connected but self-sufficient cities. 

<p>Needlab and Fabcity both aim at empowering the community from below and instilling the maker values that allow these communities be at once self-reliant and connected.</p>
