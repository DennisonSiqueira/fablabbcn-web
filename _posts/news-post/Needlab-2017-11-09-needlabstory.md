<p><strong><a href="http://www.needlab.org/" target="blank">Needlab</a></strong> is a non-profit architectural research organization started by Sameera Chukkapalli who has been collaborating with the <strong><a href="http://fab.city/about/" target="blank">Fab City</a></strong> project to explore how architecture can have a positive social impact on communities. For Sameera this begins with honouring and creating connections to places and people.</p> 

<p><em>"This helps us develop a sense of responsibility in how we use local materials, respond to social needs, and respect cultural heritage and the environment."</em></p>

<p>Needlab is always demanding more from architecture, questioning how it functions and who it serves. They believe in collectively fostering ideas in communities to solve their own problems.</p>

<p>Since 2011 <strong><a href="http://fablabbcn.org/" target="blank">Fab Lab Barcelona</a></strong> has been pioneering the <strong><a href="http://fab.city/" target="blank">FAB City</a></strong> project which aims to develop self-sufficient cities that both locally productive and globally connected. Part of this involves encouraging urban communities to adopt circular economic model that reduces the reliance on imported goods, food and resources while increasing the use of local and recycled raw materials.</p>

<p>One of Needlab’s projects was building <strong><a href="https://tuoitre.vn/nha-rau-bang-tre-va-co-tranh-giua-sai-gon-cua-co-gai-an-20170917153840948.htm" target="blank">vertical urban gardens</a></strong> using bamboo in Ho Chi Minh City for the typical Vietnamese tube houses. The problem was how to make use of extremely limited urban spaces for people to grow their own food. From the start, the project involved the community in creating a solution that used readily available, natural materials and which will be easy to replicate.</p>

<br/>

<p>The project also trained young people with the vocational skills to give them independence, help them find employment and build future urban gardens.</p>


<p><em>“In Vietnam the funding for the project was sourced from Vietnam and was invested back into the project: buying local material, training local workers and helping urban communities to grow their own food,”</em>says Sameera.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://fablabbcn.org/news/2017/08/28/B_project.html" target="blank">B_Project</a></strong> is a case example. Working with poor communities in India’s Araku valley, the project helped create alternative livelihoods through building <strong><a href="https://www.osbeehives.com/" target="blank">Open Source Beehives</a></strong> for and by local beekeeping cooperatives. This also involved learning from these communities and understanding their needs, customs, and relationship with the surrounding ecosystem.</p>

<p>“We want these communities to be connected among themselves and help each other out, share information about what worked for them, what didn’t work for them and grow,” says Sameera.</p>

<p>Fab Lab Barcelona has been pioneering the <strong><a href="http://fab.city/" target="blank">Fab City</a></strong> project which  involves empowering communities to become self-reliant through urban farming, local manufacturing, distributed energy and a circular economy. A vital component in this is also education and building bridges between a networked society and local governments to create globally connected but self-sufficient cities. 

<p>Needlab and Fabcity both aim at empowering the community from below and instilling the maker values that allow these communities be at once self-reliant and connected.</p>
