## IT starts!

Last Wednesday, **[Tomas Diez](http://iaac.net/iaac/people/tomas-diez/)**, Director of **[FabLab Barcelona](http://fablabbcn.org)**, introduced the first **[FabAcademy](http://fabacademy.org/)** session including a lesson of **Neil Gershenfeld[]()**, director of **[MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms](http://cba.mit.edu/)**. Students also met **[Luciana Asinari](http://iaac.net/iaac/people/luciana-asinari/)**, Coordinator of FabLab Barcelona, and FabAcademy Guru's: **[Ferdinand Meier](http://iaac.net/iaac/people/ferdinand-meier/)** and **[Santiago Fuentemilla](http://iaac.net/iaac/people/santi-fuentemilla/)**.

## What about the students?

This year, FabAcademy has twenty students at **[FabLab Barcelona](http://fablabbcn.org/fab_academy.html)** and five at **[Green FabLab](http://greenfablab.org/)**. Students are from 18 different nationalities and they come from beautiful countries like:  Guatemala, Germany, Malta, Mexico, Iran, Uruguay, Portugal, Turkey, Italy, South Korea, Spain, United States, Lebanon, New Zealand, France, Iceland, Slovakia and Greece.

## What is their plan?

During this 5 month part-time program, students learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objects. 
The diploma combines 19 certificates provide familiarity with technical options and capabilities, hands-on experience, and direction for further study. The certificates are:

    Digital fabrication principles and practices – 1 week
    Computer-aided design, manufacturing, and modeling – 1 week
    Computer-controlled cutting – 1 week
    Electronics design and production – 2 weeks
    Computer-controlled machining – 1 week
    Embedded programming – 1 week
    3D molding and casting – 1 week
    3D scanning and printing – 1 week
    Sensors, actuators, and displays – 2 weeks
    Interface and application programming – 1 week
    Embedded networking and communications – 1 week
    Machine design – 2 weeks
    Digital fabrication applications and implications – 1 week
    Invention, intellectual property, and business models – 1 week
    Digital fabrication project development – 2 weeks

Students at the Fab Academy also learn:

- How to use a Fab Lab’s digital fabrication tools for rapid prototyping

    Epilog Mini Lasercutter
    Roland MDX-20 Milling Machine
    3D printer
    Roland CAMM-1 Servo GX-24 Desktop Vinyl Cutter
    ShopBot

- Electronics design and production by producing circuit boards using a variety of sensors and output devices.

- How to program AVR microcontrollers on the boards they have produced.

    Molding and casting
    3D scanning and printing


We view and participate in global lectures broadcast from MIT on Wednesdays at 9:00 am – 12:00 pm EST. The lectures are recorded and available to students throughout the semester. In addition to the lectures, there are two lab days each week where students have access the digital fabrication equipment and personal help with projects.
