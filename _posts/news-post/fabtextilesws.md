<strong><a href="http://fablab.fikket.com/event/moda-de-codigo-abierto-open-source-fashion">Open Source Fashion: Digital pattern making & laser cutting</a></strong>

<p>The digital pattern is supported in tools that are on the market with a very high cost and with little compatibility between the different options. Betting on free software tools opens up interesting possibilities at the same time that allows us to diversify more in the market.</p><br>
<p>Therefore, this training proposal also aims to offer a practical vision of an open digital culture and contribute to the open source fashion community by creating a repository of patterns.  </p><br>
 
<p>Introduction to <strong><a href="https://valentina-project.org/">Seamly2D</a></strong>'s drawing, measurement file and printing tools, Creation a common repository of patterns and laser cutting. 
Seamly2D (formerly called Valentina project) is a free software digital pattern program that allows you to make measurement files, draw a pattern and apply the measurement files that you have previously filled in, to resize the pattern.At the time of drawing the pattern, <strong><a href="https://valentina-project.org/">Seamly2D</a></strong> imitates the ways of working the pattern on table. Once the pattern is done you can apply the sewing centimeters you need, join and separate pieces ...
Once finished, you can print the pattern in different ways, in plotter, by folios that are then fitted, or directly with digital manufacturing tools such as the cutting plotter or a laser cutter. 
<strong><a href="https://valentina-project.org/">Seamly2D</a></strong>'s files are exportable to Inkscape, Illustrator, Autocad and Draftsight.</p><br>
 
<p>During this workshop we work three objectives:<br>
1- Train participants in the tools of this program while following the drawing of basic patterns.<br>
2- Introduce the participants in the free software culture by participating in the creation of a repository of free patterns of the Seamly2D community<br>
3- Learn how to laser cut their patterns.</p><br>
 <br>
<p>To participate in this activity it is important to have notions of vector drawing and pattern design.<br>
.Participants must bring a laptop with the downloaded program to the workshop (see here) and a tape measure.<br><br>
.Participants will be given our digital guide for pattern making and its basic rules</p><br>
 
<p>Instructors: <strong><a href="https://fablabbcn.org/about_us.html">Anastasia Pistofidou</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://fabtextiles.org/tag/elisabeth-lorenzi/">Elisabeth Lorenzi</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://fabtextiles.org/tag/elisabeth-lorenzi/">Aldana Persia</a></strong></p><br>
 
<p>The workshop will take place only if there is a minimum of 10 participants.</p><br>

The <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/">Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC)</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.elisava.net/">ELISAVA Barcelona School of Design and Engineering</a></strong>, in collaboration with the <strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.ideasforchange.com/">Ideas for Change</a></strong>, are creating the next generation design education program: the <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/educational-programs/master-design-emergent-futures/?mc_cid=058c110b7a&mc_eid=[UNIQID]">Master in Design for Emergent Futures (MDEF)</a></strong>.<br><br>

Taught in <strong>Barcelona</strong>, one of the <strong>European capitals of innovation</strong>, the innovative program focuses in looking at the big challenges faced by humanity today in relation to <strong>climate change, sustainability, disenfranchisement and social exclusion through the lens of critical design and social innovation</strong>.<br><br>

The course will inspire, inform and critique design interventions harnessing the potential of advanced technologies such <strong>digital fabrication, artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, and blockchain</strong> aimed to address and dissolve wicked problems, while contributing learning outcomes, innovative designs and positive social impact.<br><br>

The first edition of the master, co-directed by <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/people/tomas-diez/">Tomas Diez</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/people/mara-balestrini/">Mara Balestrini</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.elisava.net/en/center/professorate/oscar-tomico-plasencia">Ã’scar Tomico</a></strong>, will incorporate advisors and guest faculty such as: <strong><a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/neil_gershenfeld">Neil Gershenfeld</a></strong>, Director of the <strong><a href="http://web.mit.edu/">Center for Bits and Atoms at MIT</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy Program</a></strong> / <strong><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/@indy_johar">Indy Johar</a></strong>, Founder of <strong><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a></strong> / <strong><a href="https://www.rca.ac.uk/more/staff/james-tooze/">James Tooze</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.rca.ac.uk/">Royal College of Arts and Design</a></strong> / <strong><a href="http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/about/people/#liz-corbin">Liz Corbin</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/">Institute of Making</a></strong>,<strong><a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/"> UCL</a></strong> / <strong><a href="http://www.haque.co.uk/">Usman Haque</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://umbrellium.co.uk/">Umbrellium</a></strong> / <strong><a href="http://www.exodesic.org/">Denis Dollens</a></strong> (PhD), <strong><a href="http://www.exodesic.org/">Studio Exodesic</a></strong>. <br><br>

The programme focuses on the <strong>design of interventions in the form of products, platforms and deployments that aim to produce new emergent futures</strong>, by previously analysing the current challenges in society and industry. Students will be encouraged to <strong>work on multiple scales</strong> in order to design and test interventions in the real world.<br><br>

The <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/educational-programs/master-design-emergent-futures/?mc_cid=058c110b7a&mc_eid=[UNIQID]">MDEF</a></strong> programme is recommended for <strong>designers, sociologists, computer scientists, economists, anthropologists, technology entrepreneurs and changemakers</strong> who are looking to develop an <strong>interdisciplinary and hybrid career</strong> path to conceive and produce impactful ideas to transform the established order. <br><br>
