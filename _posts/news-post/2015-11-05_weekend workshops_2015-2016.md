Last August, Fab Lab Barcelona participated of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fab11.org/"><u>Fab11</u></a>: the 11th Fab Lab Conference and Symposium, in Boston.
Throughout a whole week, the conference gathered hundreds of attendees from all around the world coming from Fab Labs, Hacker and Maker spaces, Schools and Universities, Community Colleges, private and public Institutions, Companies, etc.
During the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fab11.org/photos-and-video/"><u>Morning Meetings</u></a>, we learned How to make Robots, Movies, Life, Policy and Cities. We learned and shared knowledge during the afternoon workshops and catched up with some good all friends.

Once at home, and after all we’ve learned and seen during this amazing days, we still believe in Neil Gershenfeld’s statement: “The power of Digital Fabrication is social, not technical”.
