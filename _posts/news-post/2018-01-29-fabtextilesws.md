<p>The digital pattern is supported in tools that are on the market with a very high cost and with little compatibility between the different options. Betting on free software tools opens up interesting possibilities at the same time that allows us to diversify more in the market.</p><br>
<p>Therefore, this training proposal also aims to offer a practical vision of an open digital culture and contribute to the open source fashion community by creating a repository of patterns.  </p><br>
 
<p>Introduction to <strong><a href="https://valentina-project.org/">Seamly2D</a></strong>'s drawing, measurement file and printing tools, Creation a common repository of patterns and laser cutting. 
Seamly2D (formerly called Valentina project) is a free software digital pattern program that allows you to make measurement files, draw a pattern and apply the measurement files that you have previously filled in, to resize the pattern.At the time of drawing the pattern, <strong><a href="https://valentina-project.org/">Seamly2D</a></strong> imitates the ways of working the pattern on table. Once the pattern is done you can apply the sewing centimeters you need, join and separate pieces ...
Once finished, you can print the pattern in different ways, in plotter, by folios that are then fitted, or directly with digital manufacturing tools such as the cutting plotter or a laser cutter. 
<strong><a href="https://valentina-project.org/">Seamly2D</a></strong>'s files are exportable to Inkscape, Illustrator, Autocad and Draftsight.</p><br>
 
<p>During this workshop we work three objectives:<br>
1- Train participants in the tools of this program while following the drawing of basic patterns.<br>
2- Introduce the participants in the free software culture by participating in the creation of a repository of free patterns of the Seamly2D community<br>
3- Learn how to laser cut their patterns.</p><br>
 <br>
<p>To participate in this activity it is important to have notions of vector drawing and pattern design.<br>
.Participants must bring a laptop with the downloaded program to the workshop (see here) and a tape measure.<br><br>
.Participants will be given our digital guide for pattern making and its basic rules</p><br>
 
<p>Instructors: <strong><a href="https://fablabbcn.org/about_us.html">Anastasia Pistofidou</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://fabtextiles.org/tag/elisabeth-lorenzi/">Elisabeth Lorenzi</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://fabtextiles.org/tag/elisabeth-lorenzi/">Aldana Persia</a></strong></p><br>
