<p>19th of March, <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/" target="blank">IAAC</a></strong> | <strong><a href="https://fablabbcn.org/index.html" target="blank">Fab Lab Barcelona</a></strong> hosted the kick-off meeting and launch event for the <strong>Distributed Design Market Platform (DDMP)</strong>. Many international guests shared their experience and celebrated with us this <strong><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/" target="blank">Creative Europe Platforms Project</a></strong> .</p><br><br>

<p>"The members of the <strong>Distributed Design Market Platform project (Creative Europe)</strong> met at IAAC|fablab for planning events and initiatives in more than 10 European countries for supporting makers and independent designers. We found that all the members already have a lot of ideas or existing initiatives that can be supported by this project, and that in turns they can also support makers and independent designers! And, furthermore, we are working on connecting these initiatives and the members among them! We look forward to 4 years of activities, connections, support initiatives among emerging creatives, labs, organisations, cities and countries!" by Massimo Menichinelli, Project Manager Fab City Research Lab.</p><br><br>

<p>Could we reduce the ecological footprint of products, democratise the access to quality design and expand the market for designers, makers and manufacturers?
How will we connect the world of design with the maker movement?</p><br><br>

<p>The Distributed Design Market Platform (DDMP) is a Creative Europe Programme project for the promotion of the distributed work of independent designers and makers in Europe and the world, with the aim of strengthening a creative community of more than 13,000 registered users on Fablabs.io who are fabricators, artists, scientists, engineers, educators, students, amateurs, professionals, ages 5 to 75+, located in more than 40 countries in more than 1,200 Fab Labs. </p><br><br>

<p>The Platform aims at promoting and improving the connections among makers and designers with the market (Maker to Market) building on top of Fablabs.io, the online social network and official platform of the global Fab Lab Network, where Fab Labs are mapped, knowledge is shared, projects are developed and where the community discuss these topics.</p><br><br>



<p><strong><a href="https://iaac.net/" target="blank">IAAC</a> Campus</strong> in <strong><a href="http://valldaura.net/" target="blank">Valldaura Self-Sufficent Labs</a></strong> hosted last week a working session for the ROMI EU project together with IAAC’s partner <strong><a href="https://www.csl.sony.fr/" target="blank"> Sony Computer Science Laboratory Paris</a></strong> to set the starting point and the development plan of this <strong><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/" target="blank">H2020 project</a></strong>.</p><br><br>

<p><strong>The main goal of the project</strong>, which will be carried on at <strong><a href="http://valldaura.net/" target="blank">Valldaura Labs</a></strong> under the direction of <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/people/jonathan-minchin/" target="blank">Jonantan Minchin</a></strong>, is to develop an <strong>open and lightweight robotics platform for micro-farms</strong>. After a week of work and sharing, the team analysed and collected data to plan the next steps of the project and the next meetings.</p><br><br>

<p>Throughout the week, <strong><a href="https://www.csl.sony.fr/" target="blank"> Sony Computer Science Laboratory Paris</a></strong> team in collaboration with the <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/" target="blank">IAAC</a></strong> , <strong><a href="https://fablabbcn.org/index.html" target="blank">Fab Lab BCN</a></strong> Experts and the support of <strong><a href="https://noumena.io/" target="blank">Noumena</a></strong> team, build and test the first <strong>Rover ROMI</strong>. The Rover (land robot) acquires detailed information on sample plants and will be coupled with drones that acquire detailed and global information of the crop development and the overall harvest. As a first objective, and proof of concept, the purpose of developing the Rover is to assist in the mechanical control of weeds.</p><br><br>

<p>The project is coordinated by the <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/research-departments/fab-city-research-laboratory/" target="blank">Fab City research lab</a></strong> and brings together subjects such as plant modelling, adaptive learning, and high-performance computing. This research is funded by <strong><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/" target="blank">Horizon 2020</a></strong> is the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme ever with nearly €80 billion of funding available over 7 years, which promises breakthroughs, discoveries and world-firsts by taking great ideas from the lab to the market.</p><br><br>
