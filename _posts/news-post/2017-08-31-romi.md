The <strong><a href="http://fab.city/">Fab City Reseach Lab</a></strong> is glad to announce that <strong><a href="https://fablabbcn.org/index.html">Fab Lab BCN</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/">IAAC</a></strong>, together with partners, have won the <strong><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/">Horizon 2020</a></strong> funding for the project <strong>ROMI - RObotics for MIcrofarms</strong>.<br> <br>

The main goal of the project, which will be carried on at <strong><a href="http://valldaura.net/">Valldaura Labs</a></strong> under the direction of <strong><a href="https://fablabbcn.org/about_us.html">Jonantan Minchin</a></strong>, is to develop an open and lightweight <strong>robotics platform for micro-farms</strong>, to assist farmers in weed reduction and crop monitoring. <strong>ROMI</strong>’s weeding robot will <strong>reduce manual labour and increase the productivity</strong> through advanced planning tools, allowing farmers to save 25% of their time.<br> <br>

This land robot will also acquire detailed information on sample plants and will be coupled with a drone that acquires more global information at crop level. Together, they will produce an integrated, <strong>multi-scale picture of the crop development</strong> that will help the farmer monitor the crops to increase efficient harvesting.<br> <br>

The winning team, coordinated by the <strong><a href="http://fab.city/">Fab City Reseach Lab</a></strong> at <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/">IAAC</a></strong>, brings decades of experience at the forefront of the intersection between <strong>agronomy</strong>, <strong>robotics</strong> and <strong>data science</strong>, and are recognised as world leading in our application of new approaches to subjects such as <strong>plant modelling</strong>, <strong>adaptive learning</strong>, and <strong>high-performance computing</strong>.<br><br>
