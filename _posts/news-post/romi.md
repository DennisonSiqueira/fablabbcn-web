The Fab City Reseach Lab is glad to announce that Fab Lab BCN and IAAC, together with partners, have won the Horizon 2020 funding for the project ROMI - RObotics for MIcrofarms.<br> 

The main goal of the project, which will be carried on at Valldaura Labs under the direction of Jonantan Minchin, is to develop an open and lightweight robotics platform for micro-farms, to assist farmers in weed reduction and crop monitoring. ROMI’s weeding robot will reduce manual labour and increase the productivity through advanced planning tools, allowing farmers to save 25% of their time.<br> 

This land robot will also acquire detailed information on sample plants and will be coupled with a drone that acquires more global information at crop level. Together, they will produce an integrated, multi-scale picture of the crop development that will help the farmer monitor the crops to increase efficient harvesting.<br> 

The winning team, coordinated by Fab Lab BCN and IAAC, brings decades of experience at the forefront of the intersection between agronomy, robotics and data science, and are recognised as world leading in our application of new approaches to subjects such as plant modelling, adaptive learning, and high-performance computing.<br> 

The consortium is formed by a team of interdisciplinary experts in computer science (Inria, Sony), robotics and electronics (UBER, Sony, IAAC), plant modelling and agronomy (CNRS, Inria), as well as microfarming (Châtelain, IAAC). This consortium was brought together explicitly in order to cover every step, from hardware and software development to field studies and commercialisation.<br> 



The aim of <strong><a href="http://www.needlab.org/">B_project</a></strong> is to Make and install beehives for the apiary, which will generate income for the livelihood of the tribe in <strong>Araku valley</strong>, <strong>India</strong>.

This project was designed and developed by <strong><a href="http://www.needlab.org/">Needlab</a></strong> in collaboration with <strong><a href="http://barcelona.makerfaire.com/">Fablab Barcelona</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.osbeehives.com/">OSBH</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThinkPeaceworld/">Thinkpeace- world</a></strong>.

This summer <strong><a href="http://www.needlab.org/">Needlab</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.osbeehives.com/">Open Source Beehives</a></strong> visited <strong>Araku valley</strong> and started a dialog with the tribal community. They learned a lot about the tribal community, their lifestyle to live in harmony with nature by following organic farming and Beekeeping.

You can help this Project and <strong>adopt a hive</strong> which will in turn fund the installation of the bee-hives in the apiary. The donor's name will be displayed on the bee-hive and they can monitor the health of the hive they have adopted, by looking at the sensor data on the <strong><a href="http://www.needlab.org/">Needlab</a></strong> Website.
