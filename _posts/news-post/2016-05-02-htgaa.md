**[Bio Academy](http://bio.academany.org/)** is a computational and synthetic biology program aiming to guide students into using engineering principles to design and assemble biological components in the context of small and networked labs.

Students will be introduced to subjects such as DNA Nanostructures, Synthetic Minimal Cells, Bio production, Bio design, diversity & selection,  Genome Engineering, Biofabrication and additive manufacturing, Gene Drives & Synthetic Ecosystems, Computational protein design, biosensors and the protein-folding, among others.

Bio Academy is a distributed educational model providing a unique educational experience where each node that participates in the program is part of a the global Fab Lab network. Every week students take part of video lectures and discussions, and each lesson is followed by lab days in which students have access to equipment and experts to help them develop their assignments. Bio Academy faculty, who are leaders in their respective fields, provide global video lectures, supervise academic content, and guide research. This distributed educational model liberates experimental sciences and narrows the huge disjunction between the current scientific locus where experimentation takes place only in closed institutional environments, and the more open environment of Fab and Bio labs. 

Bio Academy or HTGAA is directed by George Church, professor of Genetics at Harvard medical school.
