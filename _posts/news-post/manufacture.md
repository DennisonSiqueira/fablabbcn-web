<h4>June 23rd at In3dustry: Manufacturing the Future</h4>


A series of inspirational talks to discover future scenarios in advanced manufacturing and distributed production, and understand how are going to transform our cities and society. A multi scalar journey through technologies and applications that are disrupting the way things are made: from biomaterials to space architecture. "Manufacturing the Future" brings together a selected group of researchers, thinkers and practitioners from different fields of knowledge who have transformed (are transforming), and will transform the way we produce and distribute almost anything.
