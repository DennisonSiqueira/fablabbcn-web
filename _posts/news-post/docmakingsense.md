Can a low cost sensor change the reality of a city? And dozens of them? In the spring of 2016, different groups of citizens in Barcelona, Pristina and Amsterdam concerned about noise pollution, air quality and gamma radiation in their neighborhoods begin to collect data with the <strong><a href="https://smartcitizen.me/">Smart Citizen Kit</a></strong> to measure the scope of their problems and try to find solutions. At first, governments do not recognize the data as valid because they do not come from official sensors. But the revolution of citizen science is unstoppable. Discover these experiences in the documentary <strong>"Citizen Science Revolution"</strong>, produced by the <strong><a href="http://making-sense.eu/">Making Sense</a></strong> team, in collaboration, among others, with <strong><a href="https://fablabbcn.org/index.html">Fab Lab BCN</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/">IAAC</a></strong> and the <strong>European Commission (H2020)</strong>.<br><br>

Smart Citizen is a platform to generate participatory processes of people in the cities. Connecting data, people and knowledge, the objective of the platform is to serve as a node for building productive and open indicators, and distributed tools, and thereafter the collective construction of the city for its own inhabitants.<br><br>

<strong><a href="http://making-sense.eu/">making-sense.eu</a></strong> <br><br>

Making Sense showed how open source software, open source hardware, digital maker practices and open design can be effectively used by local communities to appropriate their own technological sensing tools, make sense of their environments and address pressing environmental problems in air, water, soil and sound pollution.<br><br>

Over the past two years, hundreds of local citizens have been actively engaged in citizen science all over Europe. With pride, the Making Sense team now officially presents the <strong><a href="http://making-sense.eu/publication_categories/toolkit/">‘Citizen Sensing, a toolkit’ (pdf)</a></strong>, which describes all methods, lessons and best practices. The toolkit is a blueprint for policy makers, city makers and other actively involved citizens to facilitate community-driven data collection.
