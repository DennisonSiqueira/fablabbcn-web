A worldwide network is working out the concept of locally productive and globally connected cities: a Fab City. Fab City is a new urban model for self-sufficient cities in which citizens are empowered. To become a Fab City requires having a more precise knowledge of the way cities work.

<h4>The answer is: yes! Finally, Amsterdam joined the Fab City pledge, so today there's nine cities that joined this global iniciative: Barcelona, Boston, Somerville, Cambridge, Ekurhuleni, Kerala, Georgia, Shenzhen and Amsterdam.</h4>
