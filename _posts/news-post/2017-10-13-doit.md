The <strong><a href="https://fablabbcn.org/index.html">Fab Lab Barcelona</a></strong>, together with its <strong>International Consortium</strong>, will work to develop the new <strong><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/">Horizon 2020</a></strong> project <strong>"DO IT"</strong>.

<strong>DOIT is the European Initiative to empower Europe’s young innovators in an open digital world with the skills and tools they need from early on in life</strong>. Making Europe a better place and to build a more inclusive society needs initiative and knowledge – from youngest age on. Social entrepreneurship is the addressed competence that helps to support such challenges.<br><br>

<strong>Children and youngster from 6 to 16 years old</strong> are involved within the project, that will deliver a <strong>European platform</strong> with a huge collection of <strong>templates and materials for young entrepreneurs</strong>, a collection of success stories, materials for educators and teachers.<br><br>

<strong>The DOIT initiative builds on innovative open educational approaches that favour concrete making, application and experiences</strong>. The programme is piloted and evaluated across <strong>10 European countries</strong>, in schools, innovation labs, maker spaces and social enterprises. It offers intergenerational workshops and training events targeted at different learning needs and settings. <strong>DO IT</strong>’s online <strong>Idea Competition</strong>, open to all children in Europe, will inspire them to pursue an entrepreneurial career path.<br><br>

<strong><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/">Horizon 2020</a></strong> is <strong>the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme</strong> ever with nearly €80 billion of funding available over 7 years, which promises breakthroughs, discoveries and world-firsts by taking great ideas from the lab to the market.<br><br>

By coupling research and innovation, <strong><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/">Horizon 2020</a></strong> is helping to achieve this with its emphasis on excellent science, industrial leadership and tackling societal challenges. <strong>The goal is to ensure Europe produces world-class science, removes barriers to innovation and makes it easier for the public and private sectors to work together in delivering innovation</strong>.
