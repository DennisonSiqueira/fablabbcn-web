"The CAPS EU funded project Making Sense, coordinated by the Fab Lab Barcelona, shows how citizens can use open source technology and open sensors to collectively act at the civic level. Making Sense developed an easy to install Toolkitâ€”including a sensor kit and a data platformâ€”which allows citizens to collect, share, and interpret open data about temperature, humidity, noise, and air quality. The project enables citizens, city halls, and communities to use data for the common good, since it can improve citizensâ€™ environmental awareness. The smart Citizen Sensing Toolkit fosters citizensâ€™ engagement in solving urban environmental issues they care about. It also facilitates their collaboration with experts and technologists to achieve positive change through real world pilots."<br><br>
