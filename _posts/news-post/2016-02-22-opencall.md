####Open call for residencies!

As a second stage in our EU funded **[Made@EU Creative Europe project](https://madeat.eu/)**, we are offering a residency in Paris and another one in Barcelona, for creative professionals to develop projects that explore the integration of 3-D digital fabrication systems into their processes of design and production.

We are looking for highly motivated and experienced creative artists, craftspeople, designer-makers, and hackers, (hardware, software and systems). Candidates should ideally have some understanding of the potential of digital processes in relation to their work enough to make a convincing project proposal.

We envisage selecting between 3 and 5 residences lasting anything from 3 weeks continuous to, for example, 1 week per month for 3 months. The residencies can be Part Time or Full Time, with flexible schedules to be agreed with applicants, according to the project proposed. 

To make an application, please complete the following on-line Application Form for **[Barcelona Residency](https://madeat.eu/residency_applications/new?locale=en&venue=barcelona)** and **[Paris Residency](https://madeat.eu/residency_applications/new?locale=en&venue=paris)**.
