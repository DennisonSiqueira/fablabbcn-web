#### Digital Champions!

Fab Lab Barcelona at IAAC was selected amongst top [**100 Digital Champions**](https://www.ft.com/content/6d68a236-e153-11e8-8e70-5e22a430c1ad) by The Financial Times! We are honoured to be included and will continue using #TechForGood together with other digital champions! One of our favourite #TechForGood moments from 2018 came from the #ambmakers program run by our Future Learning Unit in collaboration with Fundació Pere Tarrés, Barcelona Ciutat Digital and Micro:bit Educational Foundation. Young people [made a low-tech device ](https://twitter.com/FutureLearningU/status/1062623312365400065)for their grandparents which alerted family members in the case of a fall!

#### Research and Innovation

It’s been another epic year for **10 EU projects** currently open at Fab Lab Barcelona, with research & development ranging from agricultural robotics to distributed platforms for design! **DSISCALE, DECODE, Do-It, Organicity, SISCODE, Grow Observatory, ROMI, Make-It, TCBL, DDMP** & **IScape!**

**Made@EU** which was coordinated by Fab Lab Barcelona at IAAC from 2014 - 2016 has been granted the title of [Creative Europe Success Story!](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/projects/ce-project-details/#project/552170-CREA-1-2014-1-ES-CULT-COOP1) "Success stories" are finalised projects that have distinguished themselves by their impact, contribution to policy-making, innovative results and/or creative approach and can be a source of inspiration for others.

The Making Sense documentary [‘Citizen Science Revolution’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvn5LyACUYw) was also released earlier this year in collaboration with Playground.

#### **Educating for our future**

[Fab Academy](https://fablabbcn.org/fab_academy_18.html) had it’s 9th year of making (almost) anything this year, culminating in the students being awarded their certifications at the Fab 14 conference in Toulouse, France. The faculty is looking forward to welcoming new students to #MakeYourJob in 2019 - the 10th year of Fab Academy Barcelona!

This past year IAAC also pioneered the [Master in Design for Emergent Futures! ](https://iaac.net/educational-programmes/masters-programmes/master-in-design-for-emergent-futures-mdef/)25 Students from 16 countries joined faculty from Fab Lab Barcelona and acquired the skills to transform them into future change agents. At the beginning of their second year the students will take a research trip to Shenzhen, China!

#### **Growing our team**

FabLab Bcn Team was expanded this year with nine new Fab Family members joining the team! We're always welcoming new faces to the team for [internships](https://fablabbcn.org/work_with_us.html) too.

#### **Growing our community**

This year we welcomed thousands of visitors to Fab Lab BCN; from the Mayor of Seoul to a hugely successful Poblenou Open Night where over 2000 visitors made something instead of buying during Black Friday for [**MakeSmthng Week**](https://medium.com/@makesmthng/lets-makechangenow-9ae6ef461894) in collaboration with Greenpeace Spain | Greenpeace International | Fab City Global Initiative. We co-produced Maker Faire with SokoTech and Sonar Festival for another year, solidifying the maker narrative in the cultural field of Barcelona.

##### A big happy holidays to all our friends, collaborators and Fab followers. Looking forward to 2019 to make more of anything with you all!
