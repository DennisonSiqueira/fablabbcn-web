<strong><a href="http://aquapioneers.io/">Aquapioneers</a></strong> project started during <strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy'16</a></strong> final project from <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/guillaume.tess">Guillaume Teyssi√©</a></strong> at the <strong><a href="http://greenfablab.org/">Green Fab Lab</a></strong>.

Since then, the project has evolved and now include two team members with <strong><a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/loic-le-goueff-4b3b36b4">Loic LeGoueff</a></strong>. Together, they are pushing for <strong>aquaponics</strong> as a mean of <strong>sustainable food production</strong> in Barcelona, and globally spread the word using <strong>the power of open source tools</strong>. From this perspective, the design of their aquaponics systems has been thought to be open in order to  facilitate its replication in other Fab Labs.

To walk the talk, last November, <strong><a href="http://aquapioneers.io/">Aquapioneers</a></strong>' team get invited in <strong><a href="http://www.sinergiatech.com/">Sinergia Tech</a></strong> (<strong>Fab Lab Montevideo, Uruguay</strong>) to <strong>beta test</strong> its <strong>Aquaponics Kit</strong>. This has been made possible thanks to the collaboration of <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/susi.garrido.73?fref=ts">Caro Vignoli</a></strong> (<strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">FabAcademyBCN'16</a></strong> student) and actual Director of <strong>FabLab Montevideo</strong>.

From these Barcelona and Montevideo experiences, they will launch a  <strong><a href="http://aquapioneers.io/">crowdfunding campaign</a></strong> in the next coming months to enable the other Fab Labs to do the same.

Stay tune !
