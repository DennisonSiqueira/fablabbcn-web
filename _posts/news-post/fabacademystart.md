Fab Academy is a Digital Fabrication program directed by Neil Gershenfeld of MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course, MAS 863: How to Make (Almost) Anything.<br>

The Fab Academy offers a 6 month program on digital fabrication, and it could be taken in any of the participating labs.<br>

This year, FabAcademy has twenty-four students at FabLab Barcelona. Students are from 14 different nationalities and they come from countries like: Spain, UK, Switzerland, china, India, France, Greece, Israel, Colombia, Antigua and Barbuda, Mexico, Italy, Philippines and Pakistan<br>

During this 6 months, our students, learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objects.<br>
The diploma combines 19 certificates provide familiarity with technical options and capabilities, hands-on experience, and direction for further study. The certificates are:<br>
Digital fabrication principles and practices – 1 week<br>
Computer-aided design, manufacturing, and modeling – 1 week<br>
