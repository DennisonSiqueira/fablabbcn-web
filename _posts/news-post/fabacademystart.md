Fab Academy is a Digital Fabrication program directed by Neil Gershenfeld of MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course, MAS 863: How to Make (Almost) Anything.<br>

The Fab Academy offers a 6 month program on digital fabrication, and it could be taken in any of the participating labs.<br>

Also here to Fab Lab Barcelona, during this 6 months, our students, learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objects.<br>
