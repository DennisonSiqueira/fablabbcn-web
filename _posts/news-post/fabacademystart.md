<h4>We are ready to start!</h4> 

January 25th, more of <strong>400 students from 70 different sites</strong>, attend the first lesson of professor <strong>Neil Gershenfeld</strong> from Boston. 

This year, FabAcademy has twenty-four students at <strong><a href="http://fablabbcn.org">FabLab Barcelona</a></strong>. Students are from 14 different nationalities and they come from countries like: Spain, UK, Switzerland, china, India, France, Greece, Israel, Colombia, Antigua and Barbuda, Mexico, Italy, Philippines and Pakistan<br>

<strong><a href="https://iaac.net/iaac/people/luciana-asinari/">Luciana Asinari</a></strong>, Coordinator of FabLab Barcelona, and <strong>FabAcademy Guru <a href="https://iaac.net/iaac/people/santi-fuentemilla/">Santiago Fuentemilla</a></strong> will introduce the first FabAcademy session 2017. <br>

<strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a></strong> is a <strong>Digital Fabrication program</strong> directed by <strong>Neil Gershenfeld</strong> of <strong><a href="http://cba.mit.edu/">MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms</strong> and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course, MAS 863: <strong>How to Make (Almost) Anything.</strong><br>

The Fab Academy offers a <strong>6 month program</strong> on digital fabrication, and it could be taken in any of the participating labs.<br>

During this 6 months, our students, learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objects.<br>
The diploma combines <strong>19 certificates</strong> provide familiarity with technical options and capabilities, hands-on experience, and direction for further study. The certificates are:<br>
Digital fabrication principles and practices – 1 week<br>
