Manfred Karrer, an Austrian software developer who lives in Barcelona, is working on Bitsquare since early 2014. In the search for becoming active in the Bitcoin field he tried to find a solution for something what most people said it is impossible: A decentralized Bitcoin-Fiat exchange. After a few months of research he started to implement a prototype which has evolved later into a fully functional trading application.<br>
<br>

His professional background is more on UI development and online games. He studied computer science, social anthropology and music. The social and political dimension of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is that what interests him most. This presentation will cover the questions why a decentralized Bitcoin exchange is needed and how to build it. It will focus on the political and conceptual aspects and will give a short demo of the software.
