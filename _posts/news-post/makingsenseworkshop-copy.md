A ‘FabCity Campus’ has been set up as part of **[Europe by People](http://europebypeople.nl/)**, the Amsterdam EU2016 Arts & Design programme and is inspired by the ‘Fab City’ initiative that started in Barcelona two years ago. 

Fab City is a global project to develop locally productive and globally connected cities. By the year 2054 cities should be self-sufficient. FAB City started as the Barcelona pledge: a countdown during the Fab10 event held on July 7th 2014 in Barcelona. Launched by the Institut d’Arquitectura Avançada de Catalunya, the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms, the Fab Foundation and the Barcelona City Council. This initiative is open for other cities, towns or communities to join in order to collectively build in a collective manner a more human and inhabitable new world.

Cities are where most of the planet’s population now live, and they offer the best opportunity to effect practical change at scale, and in a context to which people can relate. Cities are at the heart of addressing the social and environmental challenges of the 21st century.


About

The FAB City is a global project to develop locally productive, self-sufficient and globally connected cities; it comprises an international think tank of civic leaders, fab lab champions, makers, urbanists and innovators working on changing paradigm of the current industrial economy where the city operates on a linear model of importing products and producing waste.

FAB City is a new urban model of transforming building and shaping cities that shifts how they source and use materials from ‘Products In Trash Out’ (PITO) to ‘Data In Data Out’ (DIDO). This means that more production occurs inside the city, along with recycling materials and meeting local needs through local inventiveness. A city’s imports and exports would mostly be found in the form of data (information, knowledge, design, code).

In this way, the citizens and the city are empowered to be the masters of their own destiny, their resilience is increased and a more ecological system is developed because the movements of materials and the associated energy consumption and carbon emissions typical of the current economy are drastically reduced. In order for this to be possible, the city must be locally productive and globally connected to knowledge, economic and social networks, making cooperation between cities, citizens and knowledge centres the basis of the scientific knowledge.
How

To become a FAB City requires having a more precise knowledge of the way the cities work. The evolution of the project will make it possible to create better systems of capturing and analysing data, developing knowledge about a city, and it will also the implementation of an evaluation system and meticulous monitoring.
Why

This initiative is a great economic opportunity for participating cities, because it will create new types of jobs and professions related to the knowledge economy and the development and implementation of new approaches and technological solutions, including:

    Manufacturing locally, and creating global impact: A global network of cities that share knowledge and best practices on urban solutions emerging from citizens, companies, educational institutions, and governments. Local networks of Fab Labs and production centres connected to the larger global network of supply chains, sharing knowledge, best practices and projects.
    Distributed energy production: With the advent of domestic batteries and efficiency improvements in solar and other means of clean power generation, energy distribution itself will face enormous changes. Distributed grids will change the role of households and businesses in power, water and resources distribution.
    Crypto currency for a new economy: Cities creating their own trade market connected to a global economy, using a multi-currency and value system based on the block chain and similar technologies.
    Food production and urban permaculture: Urban farming will scale up from experimental practice to large-scale infrastructure. Local production of foods at domestic, neighbourhood and city scales, will create a closed loop system for food production and harvesting.
    Educating for the future: incorporate a stronger emphasis on Upgrade the educational system towards a more learn-by-doing process in education systems and curricula, and by engaging all levels of education in finding solutions of for local needs, through digital fabrication technologies, and by sharing them it with global networks.
    Building the future circular economy: Reduce the amount of imported goods, food and resources like water or energy. Increase the use of recycled raw materials for the production of objects in cities.
    Collaboration between governments and the civil society: local government and civic organizations, start-ups, universities, and other organizations must work together in order to make a cultural shift that promotes the empowerment of the cities and their citizens.

All these initiatives will be supported by technologies such as: digital manufacturing, the energetic rehabilitation energy upgrades of buildings and neighbourhoods, smart energy networks, electrical mobility, urban or urban permaculture, intelligent infrastructure, and related policy and regulatory approaches, among other solutions to be shared globally between cities.

In early April 2016 a temporary, freely accessible campus will be built at the head of Amsterdam’s Java Island in the city’s Eastern Harbour District. Conceived as a green, self-sustaining city, the FabCity campus will comprise some 50 innovative pavilions, installations and prototypes. More than 400 young students, professionals, artists and creatives will develop the site into a sustainable urban area, where they will work, create, explore and present their solutions to current urban issues. The participants are from various educational backgrounds, including art academies, (technology) universities and vocational colleges.

FabCity will take place from 11 April up and until 26 June.



FabCity is a temporary living lab, built on Java island, where the future of our cities is being explored, developed and demonstrated. The campus is initiated by the EU2016 Arts & Design programme ‘Europe by People, the Future of Everyday Living’. It will be inhabited by students, scientists and (social) entrepreneurs, and will also function as a big maker space; a place to collectively experiment, prototype and test new ways of creating an improved future urban environment.

FabCity continues from April until the end of June and will consist of several pavilions showing different innovative ideas for the connected, self-sufficient and circular city, among which the cardboard Wikkelhouse by Fiction Factory and the BAM 3D concrete printer.

<br>
El taller incluyó: un tutorial de impresión 3D con Rhinoceros orientado a la creación de cadenas geométricas que pueden funcionar como mallas flexibles sobre el cuerpo; ejercicios de corte láser de patrones para probar las diferentes propiedades del material, como su flexibilidad, volumen, textura, etc; ejercicios de digitalización de imágenes y conversión de éstas a bordados usando la bordadora digital; tramado, pintura en tela, etc.
