Whereas the <strong>2016 edition</strong> focused on the community of French and Francophone fab labs and made the creation of the French Network of Fab Labs possible, the <strong><a href="http://www.fablabfestival.fr/">2017 edition</a></strong> is called <strong>Make Europe</strong> and seeks to bring together European <strong><a href="https://www.fablabs.io/">fab labs</a></strong> to testify to the dynamism of these structures in Europe and to explore the possibilities of increasing the <strong>European network</strong>. With an ambitious program and top sponsorship, <strong>Make Europe</strong> proposes four days of diverse events intended to create surprising experiences outside of the day-to-day.
