The community of Fab Lab BCN expresses its consternation and its strongest condemnation for the terrorist attack in Barcelona and expresses its support and solidarity to the victims and their relatives and friends. Barcelona has always been a symbol for freedom and democracy, diversity and tolerance, which is what terrorism is fighting. Fab Lab BCN, home of education, research and multicultural dialogue, is totally against violence and hatred. These days, more than ever, we are all Barcelona. <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TotsSomBarcelona?src=hash">#totssomBarcelona</a></strong><br>
