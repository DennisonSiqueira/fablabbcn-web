Fab 11 // Boston

Last August, Fab Lab Barcelona participated of FAB11: the 11th Fab Lab Conference and Symposium, in Boston.
Throughout a whole week, the conference gathered hundreds of attendees from all around the world coming from Fab Labs, Hacker and Maker spaces, Schools and Universities, Community Colleges, private and public Institutions, Companies, etc.
During the morning meetings, we learned How to make Robots, Movies, Life, Policy and Cities. We learned and shared knowledge during the afternoon workshops and catched up with some good all friends.

And for the weekend, the Fab Festival offered us a taste of what the rest of the community is doing in the maker scene in Boston and around the area. We also had the chance to enjoy the Fab Textiles show, curated by Anastasia Pistofidou with pieces from all over the world; and the mayor’s panel on “Making Cities”.

Once at home, and after all we’ve learned and seen during this amazing days, we still believe in Neil Gershenfeld’s statement: “The power of Digital Fabrication is social, not technical”.
