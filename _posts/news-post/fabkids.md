"The learning process through experimentation and technology has no boundaries!" by Santiago Fuentemilla

The <strong>FabKids</strong>, is a creative laboratory that favors the development of intelligence, creativity and imagination of children and youth. It is a place where thinking is encouraged and innovation occurs, a space where educational and recreational activities for children between 10 and 16 years of age, focus on design and digital manufacturing processes.<br>

During the 4-day workshops, children use technology intuitively. One of our motivations is to promote reflective, analytical and critical thinking. We think it is necessary that children become technologically skilled; for them to become active creators with the use of technology, smart objects and video games instead of being passive users.<br>

The children have discovered and lived the philosophy of the <strong>Fab Lab Barcelona</strong> and <strong>Green Fab Lab</strong>.<br>

Located in the <strong>Collserola Natural Park</strong>, in the heart of the metropolitan area of <strong>Barcelona</strong>, <strong>Green Fab Lab</strong> hosted part of the event. The students have approached different themes: self-sufficient habitat, pollution, environment protection and many others.<br>

Green Fab Lab is a project promoted by <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/">IaaC (Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia)</a></strong> and part of the Fab City network. The Green Fab Lab works towards the creation of a self-sufficient habitat and research centre at Can Valldaura.<br>
