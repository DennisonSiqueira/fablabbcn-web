An 'Intelligent Guerilla Beehive' is a functional sculpture, a shelter that provides a home for swarming bee colonies. The work focuses on the architecture of the beehive as a organic sculptural object.The biomimetic-inspired design (in form and matter) is shaped upon the needs of the bees: it has the the ideal inner volume for a developing colony, it is mobile and easily deployable on different spots in public space : e.g. attached to the wall of a building or secured on the branch of a tree - or the objects can find a place as a stand-alone sculpture on the terrace of a city apartment. The objects are made out of smart organic materials with useful biomimetic properties in reaction to temperature fluctuation, humidity and ventilation. Once the colony decides to leave the hive, the object should fall as a rotten apple from a tree and decompose completely. It has to be a cradle to cradle design. In a second phase, I would like to add bio-sensors (e.g. for measuring the temperature inside/outside) incorporated in the 3D-printed skin. The sensors give the intelligent sculpture a futuristic view, and make it entirely appropriate for a non-intrusive observation of the bee colony as well as the monitoring of the environment. Microbial fuel cells, fed with organic waste from the beehive, will power the sensors. Once realised, these sculptural prototypes are a perfect blend of biodegradable materials and green technology.<br>

" I dance. I dance and your eyes follow my form. My silhouette creates fluid constellations in the space your eyes navigate. My body is my instrument. I control. I control my feet, my hands, my neck, my spine but it all comes out as one.
Can you see ? Can you hear?"

Elastica is a wearable suit , developed with low cost, DIY embroidered stretch sensors that functions as an interface for the performer, augmenting his body, creating sound and data visualisation. Through the use of E-textile and conductive threads, the body biometrics allow performers to capture data of their behaviour, enhancing how they engage with a external environment. After a study on the anatomy of the body and the expansion of the muscles, the stretch sensors are integrated to a tailored suit that through Wifi communicates with MAXmsp interface to generate audio/visual output. 
Elastica  becomes an interface instrument for the performer, creating real-time dialogue between fashion and dance, wearable technologies and data visualisation.

Project > "Liquid series: Melancholia II</h4><br>
<h5>Technical support> Guillem Camprodon, Anastasia Pistofidou</h5>



​Liquid ​
series ​rises
 
​
from
 an abstract idea​ of
 how can an object with a great physical strain can momentarily liquefy and blur its spacial and physical characteristics through a visual game. In this line of research, the geometry of the object takes the form of the truncated polyhedron. This truncated polyhedron enigmatically appears in an engraving of 1514 called Melancholia I​, made by the famous German Renaissance 
artist,​ ​
Albrecht Dürer​.​
​
​
​
​For a long period, ​theorists, 
mathematicians and art historians ​are trying to 
interpret the symbolism of the composition, where the objects related to geometry or mathematics, ​such as
 a sphere or this polyhedral shape that seems so interesting, ​are ​
carefully introduced with ​diverse
 objects and main characters.
​I
n ​Melancholia I
, the object consists of ​the
 physical ​sculptural ​
recreation of the truncated polyhedron, where the different states of matter ​are ​
narratively ​revealed
 to the viewer​'s senses. This narration is achieved by the object rotating at its axis and augmented by projection mapping.

The second part of the series, ​Melancholia II, the geometry itself breaks into two pieces, deforms and generates new shapes, distorts and comes back to its reconstruction.

Project >​ The Robot's secret​


The Robot's secret is a project that seeks to reply to the digital era of mass customisation by blending traditional crafts and technology. Can we create platforms for open design and make them accesible to everybody? Can the creative process be participatory and democratised? 
Traditional carving tools and a hot wire cutter are attached on 6 axis industrial robot that follows a path to carve ceramics and give traditional craftsman a new design tool for fabrication. 
The Robot's secret works on the idea of materialising the invisible sound waves into touchable ceramic pieces. The sound input generates the robotic movement, leaving its trace on the ceramic piece.

Batuque

“Batuque” is a performance inspired by the Afro-Brazilian faith Candomblé. In this belief the entities are represented by people wearing specific clothing as part of a ritual that transposes them into another dimension. The name “Batuque” is used to refer to the religion, especially before the 19th century and is also the Brazilian word associated with percussion instruments and with african roots. In this performance the wearer becomes a sort of creature or entity that has an extra sense. Its skin senses the surround sound and reacts to it accordingly, with movements and vibrations. The garment uses sensor technology and digital prototyping techniques, such as 3d printing and laser engraving, to create a magical and enjoyable experience.
