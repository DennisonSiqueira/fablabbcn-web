Learning and education are a key factor for generating positive changes in our society, since they are the basis of the society of tomorrow, which lies in the hands of future generations. Through our work and others’, we know about many inspiring projects using digital social innovation (DSI) both as a method of learning and a way of delivering positive social changes. The working group will explore the impact of increase the access to digital skills and learning through digital social innovation projects. The first part is an introduction to the topic and the review of some inspiring examples. The second part is a working group where the attendes explore the posibilities and topics where the access to digital skills and learning can be used to tackle social challenges, and to ensure people have the skills to thrive in a world in which many of our known paradigms seem to be crumbling.

FAB City takes the ideals of the Fab Lab - the connectivity, culture and creativity - and scales it to the City. It is a new urban model of transforming and shaping cities that shifts how they source and use materials from ‘Products In Trash Out’ (PITO) to ‘Data In Data Out’ (DIDO). This means that more production occurs inside the city, along with recycling materials and meeting local needs through local inventiveness. A city’s imports and exports would mostly be found in the form of data (information, knowledge, design, code). [<strong><a href="https://fablabbcn.org/about_us.html">Tomas Diez</a></strong>]<br><br>
