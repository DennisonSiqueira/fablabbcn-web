<h4>A public think tank in the heart of Barcelona</h4>

Join the community of Civic Lab Barcelona, an online and offline platform that strives to spur interactive initiatives bridging civic tech(nologies) actors and the public arena. The idea is to federate lectures, pitches, debates but also workshops, hackathons and studios designed for the community to seize the tools to improve its political system. Civic Lab Barcelona is a transparent agora relying on knowledge sharing interactions. <br>
<br>
To present our initiative, we are launching an interactive event at FabLab Barcelona, starting off the conversation with other stimulating and inclusive platforms such as Fab Lab, as well as engaging guest speakers. Further, we will spark a debate revolving around social movements and the impulse of digital platforms to empower citizens. The conversation will be led by a panel of four organizations, namely X.net, Osoigo, Kuorum and Poletika each explaining the extent to which they bridge citizens and representants.<br>
<br>
In the spirit of fostering interactions, following the debate and Q&A, we will hold an informal networking session to break the distance and discuss with the speakers first hand around a chilled beer.<br>
<br>
Tag along on our adventure, and see you on the 31st!
