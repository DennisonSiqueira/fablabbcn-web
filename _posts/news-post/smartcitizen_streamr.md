<i>“We believe that Streamr and Smart Citizen are a perfect match to enable a more inclusive and accessible Smart City, in which citizens can generate wealth by using open source sensors and have access to data markets that are secure and distributed around the world. We are definitely reinventing what the Smart City means, we are enabling the growth of Smart Citizens that are masters of their own destiny.”<i> Smart Citizen founder, <strong><a href="https://fablabbcn.org/about_us.html">Tomas Diez</a></strong>.<br><br>

<strong><a href="https://www.streamr.com/">Streamr</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://smartcitizen.me/">Smart Citizen</a></strong> partner to create decentralised pollution monitoring networks, on a not-for-profit platform, where families and researchers can subscribe to the data.<br><br>

In East London, in a neighbourhood that sits next to the 2012 Olympic Park, <strong><a href="https://www.streamr.com/">Streamr</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://smartcitizen.me/">Smart Citizen</a></strong> and other partners on the ground will work with businesses and households to help them host their very own <strong><a href="https://smartcitizen.me/">Smart Citizen</a></strong> sensors. Those sensors will produce granular real-time information about particulate and NO2 levels. Through WiFi, this data will be fed to Streamr’s Editor and Marketplace, and made available for subscription to the people who want that information the most: government agencies, environmental bodies, or even concerned parents. By monetising that data, we expect to create just the right incentives to encourage neighbouring communities to invest in sensors themselves, because they will earn money for doing so.<br><br>

<strong><a href="https://2018.steamconf.com/">STEAMConf Barcelona 2018</a></strong> is an International Education Conference, in its fourth edition, had the mission to demonstrate the vital importance of implementing programmes and resources that help minimise the digital gap and gender imbalances, and promote equal opportunities. <br><br>

<strong><a href="https://2018.steamconf.com/en/workshops/">STEAMCONF BARCELONA 2018 - Future Learning Unit Workshop "Active learning phases: design learning experiences"</a></strong><br><br>

This workshop is aimed at providing an experience that inspires and motivates participants to use digital manufacturing and makers technologies in any area of the curriculum and also at implementing methodologies in the classroom, oriented towards project based learning (PBL).<br><br>

Our learning methodology is based on short exercises, designed to encourage creativity and imagination among participants, as well as stimulating the search for tools and solutions for a correct definition. The workshop was focused on the design and creation of active learning experiences using digital manufacturing tools for all ages.<br><br>
