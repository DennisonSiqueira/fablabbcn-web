<strong><a href="https://2018.steamconf.com/en/workshops/">STEAMCONF BARCELONA 2018 - Future Learning Unit Workshop "Active learning phases: design learning experiences"</a></strong><br><br>

This workshop is aimed at providing an experience that inspires and motivates participants to use digital manufacturing and makers technologies in any area of the curriculum and also at implementing methodologies in the classroom, oriented towards project based learning (PBL).<br><br>

Our learning methodology is based on short exercises, designed to encourage creativity and imagination among participants, as well as stimulating the search for tools and solutions for a correct definition. The workshop was focused on the design and creation of active learning experiences using digital manufacturing tools for all ages.<br><br>
