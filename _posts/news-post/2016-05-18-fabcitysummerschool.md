<h4>DESIGN NOW</h4>

curated by: Luisa Collina, Stefano Maffei<br>
<br><br>
with: Laura Galluzzo and Vanessa Monna<br>

<br>
Design Now is a programme promoted by the School of Design at the Politecnico di Milano and Consortium POLI.design, with the support of Polifactory, Politecnico di Milano’s makerspace, in partnership with Triennale di Milano and with the patronage of Cumulus International Association, the most important worldwide network of Schools of Design, Arts and Media, comprising over 250 institutions. Design Now is a programme of collective open designing activities that focus on concrete experimentation in one of the main themes of the XXI Triennale: “21st Century: Design after Design”. In fact, the programme focuses on the advent of distributed production, which has modified the familiar roles and approaches practised and taught in recent design history. The main purpose of the initiative is to involve the most important Italian and international design Schools in a practical design exploration of this key-theme for society and the design discipline itself. All the activities will take place at Politecnico di Milano’s School of Design and Polifactory in Bovisa Campus.<br>

<h4>The program includes three design activities:</h4>

<li>a JAM - “When Production goes into the city”, which focuses on the relationship between service design and the new models of production-distribution. The jam will take place on May 20th-21st in 6 different locations in the world: Milan, Pamplona, Madeira, Pune, Medellin and Leeds.

Every jam’s location will select one or two Jammers, who will have direct access to the Summer School.</li>


<li>a SUMMER SCHOOL - “FAB City: Designing Products and Services for Urban Resilience through Manufacturing”, which will be concerned with the theme of urban resilience through distributed manufacturing in Fab Cities. It will take place from July 8th to July 16th at Politecnico di Milano’s School of Design and Polifactory, which will support the participants for the entire week. The 40 participants will be selected through two channels: 30 of them through the international Call and the remaining 10 through the jams. </li>


<li>an EXHIBITION, where all the projects designed during Design Now will be presented in an exhibition in September, which will be included in the XXI Triennale’s program. Keynote Speakers will be invited to take part in the closing event and will talk about the theme of urban resilience+manufacturing.</li>
