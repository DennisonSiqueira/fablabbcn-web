The <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/">Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC)</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.elisava.net/">ELISAVA Barcelona School of Design and Engineering</a></strong>, in collaboration with the <strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.ideasforchange.com/">Ideas for Change</a></strong>, are creating the next generation design education program: the <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/educational-programs/master-design-emergent-futures/?mc_cid=058c110b7a&mc_eid=[UNIQID]">Master in Design for Emergent Futures (MDEF)</a></strong>.<br><br>

Taught in <strong>Barcelona</strong>, one of the <strong>European capitals of innovation</strong>, the innovative program focuses in looking at the big challenges faced by humanity today in relation to <strong>climate change, sustainability, disenfranchisement and social exclusion through the lens of critical design and social innovation</strong>.<br><br>

The course will inspire, inform and critique design interventions harnessing the potential of advanced technologies such <strong>digital fabrication, artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, and blockchain</strong> aimed to address and dissolve wicked problems, while contributing learning outcomes, innovative designs and positive social impact.<br><br>

The programme focuses on the <strong>design of interventions in the form of products, platforms and deployments that aim to produce new emergent futures</strong>, by previously analysing the current challenges in society and industry. Students will be encouraged to <strong>work on multiple scales</strong> in order to design and test interventions in the real world.<br><br>

The <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/educational-programs/master-design-emergent-futures/?mc_cid=058c110b7a&mc_eid=[UNIQID]">MDEF</a></strong> programme is recommended for <strong>designers, sociologists, computer scientists, economists, anthropologists, technology entrepreneurs and changemakers</strong> who are looking to develop an <strong>interdisciplinary and hybrid career</strong> path to conceive and produce impactful ideas to transform the established order. <br><br>
