We showed our ongoing projects: <br>
<br>
<ul>The new <a href="http://market.fablabs.io/">Fab Market</a>: an online market where you can find a variety of locally made products designed by people from all over the world. Products are sold ready for use, assembly or fabrication, giving the user the ability to participate in the making process.</ul><br>
<br>

<ul><a href="http://making-sense.eu/">Making Sense</a>: this Horizon 2020 European research project aim to explore how open source software, open source hardware, digital maker practices and open design can be effectively used by local communities to fabricate their own sensing tools, make sense of their environments and address pressing environmental problems in air, water, soil and sound pollution.</ul> <br>

<ul><a href="http://make-it.io/">MAKE-IT</a>: this Horizon 2020 European research project focused on how the role of Collective Awareness Platforms (CAPS) enables the growth and governance of the Maker movement, particularly in relation to Information Technology, using and creating social innovations and achieving sustainability.

<ul><a href="https://madeat.eu/">Made@EU</a> aims to integrate digital fabrication to the existing workflows of craftsmen, artists designers and artisans across Europe. This project has the support of EU Creative Europe Programme, and it's a collaboration between Europe's top research and education centers on the field of digital fabrication: IAAC | Fab Lab Barcelona, ENSCI Paris, and Plymouth Collage of Art. <br>

We presented Cristian Rizzuti's project: <a href="https://madeat.eu/cristian-rizzuti">Elastica</a> a wereable suit developed during his residency in Fab Lab Barcelona. Through the use of E-textile and conductive thread the body biometrics allow performers to capture data of their behaviour, enhancing how they engage with an external environment. 
<br>
Thanks to this project, we were awarded with the "Maker of Merit" of the Maker Faire Rome 2016. <br>
<h4>Thank you Maker Faire Rome and congratulations to the team!</h4><br>
