<p>19th of March, <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/" target="blank">IAAC</a></strong> | <strong><a href="https://fablabbcn.org/index.html" target="blank">Fab Lab Barcelona</a></strong> hosted the kick-off meeting and launch event for the <strong>Distributed Design Market Platform (DDMP)</strong>. Many international guests shared their experience and celebrated with us this <strong><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/" target="blank">Creative Europe Platforms Project</a></strong> .</p><br><br>

<p>"The members of the <strong>Distributed Design Market Platform project (Creative Europe)</strong> met at <strong>IAAC|fablab</strong> for planning events and initiatives in <strong>more than 10 European countries for supporting makers and independent designers</strong>. We found that all the members already have a lot of ideas or existing initiatives that can be supported by this project, and that in turns they can also support makers and independent designers! And, furthermore, we are working on connecting these initiatives and the members among them! We look forward to 4 years of activities, connections, support initiatives among emerging creatives, labs, organisations, cities and countries!" by <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/people/massimo-menichinelli/" target="blank">Massimo Menichinelli</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://fab.city/" target="blank">Project Manager Fab City Research Lab</a></strong>.</p><br><br>

<p>Could we reduce the ecological footprint of products, democratise the access to quality design and expand the market for designers, makers and manufacturers?
How will we connect the world of design with the maker movement?</p><br><br>

<p><strong>The Distributed Design Market Platform (DDMP)</strong> is a <strong>Creative Europe Programme</strong> project for the promotion of the distributed work of independent designers and makers in Europe and the world, with the aim of strengthening a creative community of more than 13,000 registered users on Fablabs.io who are fabricators, artists, scientists, engineers, educators, students, amateurs, professionals, ages 5 to 75+, located in more than 40 countries in more than 1,200 Fab Labs. </p><br><br>

<p>The Platform aims at promoting and improving the connections among makers and designers with the market (Maker to Market) building on top of Fablabs.io, the online social network and official platform of the global Fab Lab Network, where Fab Labs are mapped, knowledge is shared, projects are developed and where the community discuss these topics.</p><br><br>
