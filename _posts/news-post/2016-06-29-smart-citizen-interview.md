<a href= "http://nice-europe.eu/" alt= "NICE EU">The N.I.C.E. Award</a> promotes innovations through culture and creative industries into the wider economy and society to tackle the major challenges of our future today. To this end, the N.I.C.E. Award creates visibility and know-how transfer for so far overseen innovations throughout Europe, kicks off debates and impulses in business, culture and policy alike and motivates cultural and creative makers to be innovative and more experimental. <br> </h4>

<h4>The N.I.C.E. Award 2015 is looking for new and stimulating innovations that are solutions to global problems. 
What problem do you address with your project?</h4>
<br>
Cities are the largest creation of human kind. For many centuries we have been adding complexity and technology to the urban centres, creating places with the biggest problems we can find today in terms of sustainability and contamination of the planet. Being a huge producer of 
problems, cities offer at the same time great opportunities 
to address those problems by using available, accessible 
and open source technology. <br>
<br>
<mark>We believe that Smart Citizen 
can build an ecosystem of participation of citizens in the 
production of valuable data and information about our 
cities, which can help to better understand, transform and 
improve the places where next generations will live.</mark> Smart 
Citizen is about the appropriation of technology for taking 
over the active construction of the city. Our idea started 
with sensors and data visualisation, but we aim to grow and 
to develop applications and partnerships that will allow us 
to construct tools for the political participation of people in 
their city and to create a new data economy by implemen
-
ting block chain technologies in the future versions of our 
platforms.

<br>
<h4>What reactions have you received yet? Is the world 
ready for your solutions?</h4>
<br>
We crowd-funded the development of the initial phase of 
the project twice with the result of close to 1,000 people 
who actually supported us with funds. Furthermore, we 
have been able to collaborate with large corporations like 
Intel and Cisco in special projects and events to develop 
Smart Citizen. At the same time, governments of cities like 
Amsterdam, Barcelona and Manchester have actively supported the deployment of Smart Citizen in order to align it 
with their Smart City strategies –  which is a paradox, since 
Smart Citizen initially started as a critic exercise against 
the big brother and corporative approach of the Smart City 
agenda. <br>
<br>
We have been collaborating with researchers all 
over the world in universities like the University College London, the Royal College of Art, the MIT, among others, and 
in different projects related with them. <mark>Finally, we are now 
getting EU funding support to develop research around the 
technology and its implementation strategies in different 
cities in Europe.</mark> As the world is going open source, we are 
about to record the largest expansion of our project – from 
1,200 sensors and 3,200 users – and thus to play our part in 
the massive growth of the Internet of Things devices and 
open data applications.

<h4>The N.I.C.E. Award 2015 focusses on digital innovation 
through culture. How do you see the cultural sector 
influenced by digitalisation?</h4>
<br>
In Europe and most of the urbanised areas of the world it 
is almost impossible to talk about culture without talking 
about the digital revolution that we have been living in during the last 40 years. From computers to smartphones, our 
entire lives have dramatically changed, affecting how we 
learn, work, play, create and live. It is extremely important 
to create a culture with strong values on humanism through 
digital platforms, not only using screens and keyboards to 
represent traditional cultures, but by reframing the meaning of culture in a connected world and society. <br>
<br>
<h4>For us it is of high importance that these values are constructed 
around the open source and accessible knowledge on how 
things are made, how they can be shared and how they can 
be useful and valuable to others – and not just to create 
another start-up to make a little money and then be sold 
to a larger corporation. Digital culture should help build a 
new economy and a value set that can enhance the role of 
people in the production and control of their lives. </h4>
