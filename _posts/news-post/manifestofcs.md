In July 2018, as part of the Fab City Summit in Paris, the <strong><a href="http://fab.city/">Fab City Global Initiative</a></strong> launched the <strong><a href="https://fab.city/documents/Manifesto.pdf">Fab City Manifesto</a></strong>, in collaboration with the <strong><a href="https://www.paris.fr/">Mairie de Paris</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="http://fab.city/">Fab City Collective</a></strong>. This set of guiding principals are key to the development of the <strong><a href="http://fab.city/">Fab City</a></strong> roadmap and act as values by which the <strong><a href="http://fab.city/">Fab City</a></strong> network engage with their cities.
