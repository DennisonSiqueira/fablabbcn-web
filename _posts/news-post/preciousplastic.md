Their project is clear:<br>
<br>
1- Develop Machines - For the past two years we have been developing machines to recycle plastic waste, locally;<br>
2- Share, for free - The machines are developed using basic tools and materials. We share all the blueprints open source online. This way people around the world can build them;<br>
3- Spread the know-how - In order to build these machines people need to know that the blueprints are available. We need to spread the know-how to every corner of the world;<br>
4- Create - Once the machines are built people can start experimenting, creating and producing new products from their local plastic waste;<br>
5- Clean up - The primary goal is to recycle as much plastic as we possibly can. This would clean up our shared environment, improve living conditions and possibly create financial value;<br>
6- Community - An important aspect of the project is to create a world wide community of like-minded plastic savers. People working for a cleaner future, sharing knowledge, helping each other, and collaborating;<br>

You can see some of the things we have been doing in the latest weeks on the instagram page. You'll see we were able to make the waxscraper that João designed for us with the injection machine!

We brought the machines to the Rip Curl Pro in Supertubos where they were exposed at the Peniche Municipality stand and we did some demos, but unfortunately the competition was held at the other location almost every day so we didn't have as many visitors as expected..

Two weeks ago we brought them to Joao at the OPO'lab in Porto and did some demonstrations there with the kids which was really nice as well. We then decided to leave the machines there because we're not staying in Portugal, and we thought it would be easier to arrange for them to go back to Barcelona if they are at the OPO'Lab. Moreover João wanted to present the machines to the waste management company of Porto in the coming weeks.

So that's what we've been doing with the machines in Portugal. We're not planning on doing any more demonstrations so if João is done with them I think he can arrange for them to be sent back to Barcelona (he's in cc so you can talk to him directly about it).

I saw Mattia plans on making a Precious Plastic 3.0 so I'll try to share as much info as possible that I have gained from making the machines to help him succeed!<br>
