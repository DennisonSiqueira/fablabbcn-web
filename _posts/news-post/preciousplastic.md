<br>
Their project is clear:<br>
<br>
1- <strong>Develop Machines</strong> - For the past two years we have been developing machines to recycle plastic waste, locally;<br>
2- <strong>Share, for free</strong> - The machines are developed using basic tools and materials. We share all the blueprints open source online. This way people around the world can build them;<br>
3- <strong>Spread the know-how</strong> - In order to build these machines people need to know that the blueprints are available. We need to spread the know-how to every corner of the world;<br>
4- <strong>Create</strong> - Once the machines are built people can start experimenting, creating and producing new products from their local plastic waste;<br>
5- <strong>Clean up</strong> - The primary goal is to recycle as much plastic as we possibly can. This would clean up our shared environment, improve living conditions and possibly create financial value;<br>
6- <strong>Community</strong> - An important aspect of the project is to create a world wide community of like-minded plastic savers. People working for a cleaner future, sharing knowledge, helping each other, and collaborating;<br>
