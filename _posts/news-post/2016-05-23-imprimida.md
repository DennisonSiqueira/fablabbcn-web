<h4>Advanced manufacturing is transforming the production methods for artists and creators. 3D printers, code, CNC machines and robots are not only changing how we work, live and play, but they reshaping the processes and interactions between artists and technologies, and how this new mediation between machine and humans is making the process as important as the end work, all becoming a whole.</h4>

<strong>IN(3D)USTRY From Needs to Solutions, Sonar+D and IAAC</strong> are launching an open call for artists, makers and designers to participate in a 8 days workshop and further exhibition in Barcelona with experts from the field of digital fabrication and computational design in order to explore the limits of art production in our times. This 8 day workshop will be held during the Sonar+D June 16th to 18th 2016 and during IN(3D)USTRY Maker Pro exhibition from June 21st to 23rd  2016. All participants will have access to one SONAR Full Delegate pass and Full Delegate Pass for IN(3D)USTRY From Needs to Solutions event and to all the production means to make their work real.<br>
<br>
During the course participants will explore generative design techniques associated to agent behaviors and iterative strategies. The outputs of the explorations conducted during the course will be translating into an open process of fabrication mainly related to 3d printing and additive manufacturing. The final results will be exhibited in IN(3D)USTRY From Needs to Solutions inside the MAKER PRO area.<br>

<h4>SCHEDULE</h4>

The workshop will take place in 3 different places:<br>
14-15/6 | Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC), Carrer de Pujades, 102, 08005<br>
16-18/6 | Sonar +D, Advanced Music S.L.Apartado de Correos 64.004, 08080<br>
21-23/6 | Fira Barcelona<br>

 
<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>

The workshop is open to all participants, no previous knowledge of Rhinoceros and Grasshopper is required (although an introductory knowledge is welcome). Participants should bring their own laptop with a pre-installed software.  The software package needed has no additional cost for the participant (Rhino can be downloaded as evaluation version, Grasshopper and plugins are free). These softwares are subject to frequent updates, so a download link to the version used in the workshop will be sent to the participants a few days before the workshop.<br>
