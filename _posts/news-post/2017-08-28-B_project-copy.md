This project was designed and developed by <strong><a href="http://www.needlab.org/">Needlab</a></strong> in collaboration with <strong><a href="http://barcelona.makerfaire.com/">Fablab Barcelona</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.osbeehives.com/">OSBH</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThinkPeaceworld/">Thinkpeace- world</a></strong>.

This summer <strong><a href="http://www.needlab.org/">Needlab</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.osbeehives.com/">Open Source Beehives</a></strong> visited <strong>Araku valley</strong> and started a dialog with the tribal community.

You can help this Project and <strong>adopt a hive</strong> which will in turn fund the installation of the bee-hives in the apiary. The donor's name will be displayed on the bee-hive and they can monitor the health of the hive they have adopted, by looking at the sensor data on the <strong><a href="http://www.needlab.org/">Needlab</a></strong> Website.
