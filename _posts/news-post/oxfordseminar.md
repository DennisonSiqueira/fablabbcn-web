"<strong><a href="http://www.insis.ox.ac.uk/">The Institute for Science, Innovation and Society (InSIS) at Oxford University</a></strong> invited us to present the <strong><a href="https://smartcitizen.me/">Smart Citizen project</a></strong> as part of a series of seminars around the <strong><a href="http://www.insis.ox.ac.uk/news-events/news/article/date/2016/12/insis-seminar-series-science-in-your-own-hands-promises-and-perils-of-diy-science/?cHash=721c60130bcb82d1b81ebfa7d3901efb">Promises and Perils of DIY Science</a></strong>. The session was chair by <strong><a href="http://www.keble.ox.ac.uk/academics/about/professor-steve-rayner">Steve Rayner</a></strong>, director of the institute, and it was a really nice opportunity to discuss our work on <strong>Participatory Sensing</strong> and <strong>Citizen Science</strong> we have been carrying out since 2013 with the Oxford community." by <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/people/guillem-camprodon/">Guillem Camprodon</a></strong><br>

In the <strong>21st century</strong>, the production of scientific knowledge has moved beyond <strong>academic or industrial laboratories to online communities</strong>, <strong>low-rent "hackspaces"</strong>, <strong>personal wearable devices</strong>, and <strong>low-cost kits</strong> ordered from the internet. Does <strong>DIY science</strong> provide a more democratic, relevant and accountable form of <strong>self-guided expertise</strong>? Or are authority and control simply shifted and permeating the production of DIY activities in unexplored ways? How are quality and outcomes assessed? Like an ever-evolving ecosystem, knowledge production and use is expanding into new niches and functioning in creative ways among new sets of actors.<br>

This seminar explored the changing ecologies of knowledge and the implications of the public taking the production of science <strong>"into their own hands"</strong>.<br>
