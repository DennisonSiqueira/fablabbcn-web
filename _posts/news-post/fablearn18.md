Whorkshop: <strong><a href="http://fablearn.eu/workshops/">How To Create A STEAM Installation</a></strong> - 18th June 2018, Trondheim, Norway.<br><br> 

How To Create A STEAM Installation is a workshop for creative teachers which offers an impact experience, seeking to inspire and motivate the participants to use the possibilities of digital fabrication, coding and makers philosophy to treat any aspect of the curriculum, but also be able to implement methodologies in the classroom oriented towards research and project work. The challenge will be to co-create an interactive installation going through the learning by doing steps and dealing with topics such as electronics, virtual reality, video mapping, scanning and materials. We will finish reflecting on what we have learned and giving helpful resources.<br><br>
