The <strong><a href="">Fab Lab Barcelona</a></strong> together with its European Consortium, will work to develop the new <strong><a href="">Horizon 2020</a></strong> project <strong>"DO IT"</strong>.

<strong>DOIT is the European Initiative to empower Europe’s young innovators in an open digital world with the skills and tools they need from early on in life</strong>. Making Europe a better place and to build a more inclusive society needs initiative and knowledge – from youngest age on. Social entrepreneurship is the addressed competence that helps to support such challenges.<br><br>

<strong>Children and youngster from 6 to 16 years</strong> are addressed within the project, that will deliver a <strong>European platform</strong> with a huge collection of <strong>templates and materials for young entrepreneurs</strong>, a collection of success stories, materials for educators and teachers.<br><br>

<strong>The DOIT approach builds on innovative open educational approaches that favour concrete making, application and experiences</strong>.
The program is piloted and evaluated across <strong>10 European countries</strong>, in schools, innovation labs, maker spaces and social enterprises. It offers intergenerational workshops and training events targeted at different learner needs and learning settings. <strong>DO IT</strong>’s online <strong>Idea Competition</strong>, open to all children in Europe, will inspire them to pursue an entrepreneurial career path.<br><br>

Horizon 2020 is the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme ever with nearly €80 billion of funding available over 7 years, which promises breakthroughs, discoveries and world-firsts by taking great ideas from the lab to the market.

By coupling research and innovation, Horizon 2020 is helping to achieve this with its emphasis on excellent science, industrial leadership and tackling societal challenges. The goal is to ensure Europe produces world-class science, removes barriers to innovation and makes it easier for the public and private sectors to work together in delivering innovation.
