<h4>A journey towards a
more through DIGITAL and
distributed production<br>

Most stuff today are made in a very linear way. We
take, make, and dispose. The assembly line has
helped construct a world of mass manufactured
products, which relies on large quantities of cheap,
easily accessible materials and energy. Such model
is reaching its physical limits. Some say that at this
rate we’ll soon need a second planet... as if it was
even an option. But what if we could design products
that can be “made to be made again" and powering
the system with renewable energy?
In June 2016, in Barcelona, Space10 and the Fab
City Research Laboratory are launching a challenge
for our designers and makers to reflect and act on
how and why we make things.
The Made Again Conference is a series of short talks
and big ideas, around design, digital fabrication, new
materials, open source, distributed production, and
more. We’ve gathered some of the brightest minds
and best talents to share their stories and points of
view.
