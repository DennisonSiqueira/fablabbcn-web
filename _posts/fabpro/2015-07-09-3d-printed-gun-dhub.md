Fab Lab Barcelona has been invited to participate in this international collective show in which designers, artists and architects were challenged to transcend categories and conventions to explore unrecognized ways to make and design, to disrupt systems and processes.

<br>

For the show we 3D printed a gun's lower receiver, a part which connects the trigger, grip and magazine holder, and a full gun (all made our of PLA filament).

<br>

The lower receiver was designed by Ben Denio and Cody Wilson, founders of <a href="https://defdist.org">Defense Distributed</a>, and is an open source file.

The rest of the gun was designed and fabricated by Ingi Freyr Gudjonsson, from Fab Lab Barcelona.

3D printed guns have been subject to a long controversy for some time...we would like to close the post quoting Neil Gershenfeld_“A well-equipped machine shop for a long time has been able to make gun parts,”...“Three-D printers make not very good ones.”

<br>

So, we'll keep 3D printing, but I guess we'll play with something else...
