####Project :

<br>
A mix of futuristic clothing, robotics and technology

“3982” was born from IBCO and Ayoub Qanir with the goal of creating a piece of clothing with an aesthetic feature inspired by the idea of a future encompassing and crisscrossing the arts, science and technology; favoring reflection on the system and its context.
The video developed by Codea Studio with the collaboration of IAAC|Fab Lab Barcelona and Bloom has incorporated the techniques used in the creation of clothing, such as laser cut or the 3d dress patterns, in its visual content. The impulse and the technique used in this visual content consists of an iron arm attached to the camera which travels around “3982”
From material and abstraction to concreteness and futurism, a revelation with glimpses of a possible crossing between technology and humanity.
