The concept of the design of the Ele-Fab was to create a 3D puzzle that would be numbered and assembled by the kids. In order to create this elephant, a digital mesh was downloaded from the internet and adjusted to create a triangulated self-supporting structure of 95 pieces.

Additional triangulated pieces were designed to fold in from the inside in order to provide additional bracing for the exterior triangulation. All the pieces were then numbered and lasercut in cardboard at half-scale for testing purposes.

Once the design was finalized, the elephant pieces were transported to the Montjuic Castle, where kids were introduced to laser cutting techniques through a small presentation. The kids then curiously assembled the pieces by searching for similarly numbered sides and joined them with zipties.
