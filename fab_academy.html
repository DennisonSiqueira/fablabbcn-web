      <p>Fab Academy runs in more than 70 Fab Labs, for more than 250 students per year in the largest campus of the world. It is directed by Neil Gershenfeld from MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course: How to Make (Almost) Anything. Since 2009, lectures have been distributed weekly to the global Fab Academy classroom; supported locally in each Fab Lab through hands-on learning. Students will use technology such as 3D printing, laser cutting, programming and electronics to research and deliver one of twenty skill-based Certificates per week, in syndication with peers across the globe. Students will graduate from this global classroom at the annual gathering of the global Fab Lab network, FabX in the presence of Professor Neil Gershenfeld. Fab Academy is the premier course of the distributed education program, Academany, the Academy of Almost Anything.  </p>
