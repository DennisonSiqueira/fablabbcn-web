      <h2 class="my-4">The Global Classroom</h2>
      <p>Fab Academy consists of both classes online and offline disciplines, a method which we call "distributed education". Students work on two levels - global and local. The global level, otherwise known as the Global Campus, connects a total of 250 students enrolled in Fab Academy in more than 50 cities worldwide.  The students connect weekly for Global Lectures with Professor Neil Gershenfeld - Director of MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms. After every Global Lecture, in which Prof. Gershenfeld explains the content and lays out the assignment for the week, there is a round of reviews that opens the possibility for students to interact with the rest of the global community.  </p>
      <p>The Fab Academy program is based on MIT’s popular rapid-prototyping course ‘How To Make (Almost) Anything - both courses are taught by Prof. Neil Gershenfeld. The Fab Academy Diploma is awarded by the Fab Academy community with the support of the Fab Lab Network and Fab Foundation. In the past years, numerous institutions hosting the course have started accrediting the skills developed in the course - you can check these institutions 
      <a href="http://www.fabacademy.org/about/accreditations.html" target="_blank">here. </a></p>
