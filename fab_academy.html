      <h2>Join Fab Academy in Barcelona and create the future.</h2>
      <br/>
      <p>Fab Academy is an intensive ﬁve-month program that teaches students to envision, design and prototype projects using digital fabrication tools and machines. It is a multi-disciplinary and hands-on learning experience that empowers students to learn-by-doing and inspires them to make stuff locally to become active participants in sustainable cities and communities.
      </p><br/>
      <p>The course is structured around the attainment of 20 practical certificates such as Digital Fabrication Principals, Embedded programming and machine design. The content of these weekly classes is delivered online live from MIT and practiced hands-on in the Fab Lab.</p>

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/fab_academy/fabacademy4.png" class="img-responsive"/>

    <h1 class="my-4"><strong>FAB ACADEMY GLOBAL CLASSROOM</strong></h1>
    <p>Fab Academy runs in more than 70 Fab Labs, for more than 250 students per year in the largest campus of the world. It is directed by Neil Gershenfeld from MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course: How to Make (Almost) Anything. Since 2009, lectures have been distributed weekly to the global Fab Academy classroom; supported locally in each Fab Lab through hands-on learning. Students will use technology such as 3D printing, laser cutting, programming and electronics to research and deliver one of twenty skill-based Certificates per week, in syndication with peers across the globe. Students will graduate from this global classroom at the annual gathering of the global Fab Lab network, FabX in the presence of Professor Neil Gershenfeld. Fab Academy is the premier course of the distributed education program, Academany, the Academy of Almost Anything.
    </p><br/>
    <p>Over ten years, Fab Lab Barcelona has become a global benchmark for the Fab Academy experience. Students come from every continent to study in Barcelona with the Future Learning Unit and experts from Fab Lab Barcelona. Future of Education specialist and Fab Academy Barcelona Alum Santi Fuentemilla leads the hands-on instruction the lab, supported by experts in digital fabrication, robotics, machine learning, coding and materials. Students in Barcelona study in a professional lab environment. In addition, the course is delivered in collaboration with students from the IAAC Master of Design for Emergent Futures which provides an opportunity to expand ones professional and personal experiences. Alumni of the program have used their future-skills to build leading roles in the global Fab Lab network, established their own design studios and become entrepreneurs in the innovation and social design fields.</p>
